Read more ways you can use OpenCongress.</p> <h2 style="text-align: center;">Browse Non-Congressional Legal Templates and PDF Documents</h2> <p>At OpenCongress, we support free and accessible information to better inform and empower communities and individuals.</p> <p>Check one of the links below to access fillable legal documents to suit your needs (or browse our full catalogs of <a href="/legal-templates/">legal templates</a> and <a href="/pdf-forms/">fillable PDF forms</a>):</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/bill-of-sale/">Bill of Sale Template</a> &#8211; the document is used to record the ownership transfer of an item from one person (a seller) to another (a buyer). A bill of sale serves as legal evidence of many transaction types and protects both parties from any future misunderstandings. It should include all the essential details related to the transaction, including the seller&#8217;s and buyer&#8217;s contact information and a detailed description of the item to be sold.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/bill-of-sale/motor-vehicle-bill-of-sale/">Bill of Sale for Car</a> &#8211; this form is designed to prove a change in the ownership of a car, motorcycle, or other motor vehicles. It ensures that the seller hands the certificate of title over to the buyer, and the buyer purchases the vehicle being fully aware of its condition (&#8220;as is&#8221;). In many states, it&#8217;s required to sign a bill of sale to register the vehicle in the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/last-will/">Last Will and Testament Form</a> &#8211; a last will and testament is an essential legal instrument that arranges the property and assets division after a person passes away. This person, known as the testator, creates the last will to ensure that their real and personal property will be divided as they wish and not by the court order. Apart from naming the beneficiaries, the document is used to assign guardians for the testator&#8217;s minor children, if any.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/living-will/">Living Will Template</a> &#8211; the document helps a person indicate end-of-life treatment they wish or do not wish to receive if they become terminally ill. A living will provides details relating to life-sustaining treatments and define the circumstances in which they should be used. A living will usually is a part of the Advance Health Care Directive along with a Medical Power of Attorney.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/power-of-attorney/">Power of Attorney Template</a> &#8211; a power of attorney (POA) allows an individual (the principal) to appoint another person (the agent) to act as their representative. It comes in handy when a person cannot handle financial, business, or healthcare matters on their own. POAs allow the agent to assist the principal either on a short-term or a long-term basis. As a rule, a power of attorney loses its force when the principal becomes incapacitated.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/power-of-attorney/durable-power-of-attorney/">Durable Power of Attorney Form</a> &#8211; this form is used to make a power of attorney effective even after a person (the principal) becomes incapacitated. A durable power of attorney is an irreplaceable legal tool ensuring that a trusted person will manage the principal&#8217;s property and assets when the latter is no longer capable of doing that.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/small-estate-affidavit/">Small Estate Affidavit Form</a> &#8211; if someone is sure about their inheritance rights and wants to avoid a lengthy probate process, they can use a small estate affidavit to claim the assets of a deceased person. However, as the name implies, this form can be used only for the small estate that is valued below a certain amount, varying from state to state.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/rental-lease-agreement-forms/">Lease Agreement Template</a> &#8211; this binding agreement helps build a strong legal basis for successful rental relationships between a landlord (also, a lessor) and a tenant (also, a lessee). A lease agreement should consist of all the essential terms and requirements, including rent amount, pet and smoking policy, late fees, and utilities, to avoid future misunderstandings.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/eviction-notice/">Eviction Notice Template</a> &#8211; if a landlord wants to evict a tenant, they should send an eviction notice first. An eviction notice, also known as a notice to quit, specifies why the tenant must vacate the rental premises. As a rule, it also provides ways to improve or cure the situation (except when a tenant commits a crime on the premises).</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/release-of-liability-form/">Release of Liability Form</a> &#8211; the document ensures that one party, known as a releasor, will not sue another party, known as a release, who can be potentially liable. A release of liability can be used for both past and future events. This form is frequently used by business entities providing extreme activities to avoid responsibility for possible injuries or damage these activities can cause.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/promissory-note-template/">Promissory Note Template</a> &#8211; a promissory note has a binding legal value and helps to ensure that the person giving the money will receive them back. A promissory note should contain all the crucial agreement&#8217;s terms, including the loan amount, repayment schedule, collateral (if any), interest rate, and late fees. If a promissory note includes collateral, it&#8217;s called a secured promissory note.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/non-compete-agreement-template/">Non-Compete Agreement Template</a> &#8211; this document is designed to prevent one party from competing with another party in the same industry or geographical area for a certain period of time. Companies usually use a non-compete agreement when hiring new employees. However, many states do not recognize non-compete clauses, so it&#8217;s essential to consult the state laws before preparing this agreement type.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/prenuptial-agreement-template/">Prenuptial Agreement Template</a> &#8211; also known as a &#8220;prenup,&#8221; this agreement is signed by a couple who will get married. A prenup can be considered as a business partnership agreement between romantic partners, which manages financial responsibilities and obligations in the event of a divorce or death. Nevertheless, a prenuptial agreement cannot manage such issues as child custody and child support.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/llc-operating-agreement-template/">Operating Agreement Template</a> &#8211; whether it&#8217;s a single-member or multiple-member limited liability company (LLC), their owners can use an operating agreement to clearly define all LLC members&#8217; rights, obligations, and liabilities. This agreement is not required in every state, but it&#8217;s highly recommended for companies&#8217; owners who want to set their own rules and procedures for the LLCs.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/deed-forms/quitclaim/">Quitclaim Deed Forms</a> &#8211; also known as a &#8220;non-warranty deed,&#8221; a quitclaim deed is the least secure of all deed types. The form is used to transfer real estate ownership easily and quickly, but it doesn&#8217;t guarantee that the one who&#8217;s transferring has full rights to the property. That&#8217;s why a quitclaim deed is usually signed between individuals who can trust each other, for example, family members.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/marital-divorce-settlement-agreement/">Marital Settlement Agreement Template</a> &#8211; if a married couple decides to divorce, they don&#8217;t have to undergo an exhausting divorce process. With a marital (divorce) settlement agreement, they can agree in advance on such issues as assets and debts division, alimony, and child custody. Of course, it&#8217;s impossible to avoid court involvement entirely in this matter, but a marital settlement agreement can make a divorce a lot less stressful.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/nda-agreement-template/">Non-disclosure Agreement Template</a> &#8211; a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) allows the owner of confidential information to protect it from unauthorized usage. An NDA is frequently used when hiring new employees or establishing business partnership relationships. The agreement protects all sensitive data that can be shared between employees or business partners.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/letter-of-intent-template/">Letter of Intent Template</a> &#8211; as the name implies, this document serves as a way to express an intention to do something. This intention can be related to various matters, from establishing cooperation between two parties to defining future purchase details. A letter of intent (LOI) is non-binding, but it&#8217;s helpful in terms of building a basis for the forthcoming definitive agreements.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/meeting-minutes-template/">Meeting Minutes Template</a> &#8211; this document ensures that all the meeting decisions and outcomes are recorded and can be used in the future. Meeting minutes help not only inform the absent members about what happened during the meeting but also to track down the company&#8217;s or organization&#8217;s progress. Minutes should not include every detail of the meeting but rather outline key issues, votes, and plans.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/affidavit-forms/">Affidavit Form</a> &#8211; with an affidavit form, a person confirms under oath that the written statement is true. An affidavit can be used for many reasons such as verifying someone&#8217;s identity, attesting birth or death, or presenting formal statements as a witness. It&#8217;s a legally binding document and should be signed voluntarily and in the presence of a notary public.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/purchase-agreement/">Purchase Agreement Template</a> &#8211; the agreement outlines the terms and conditions of a future transaction between a seller who wants to sell the property and a buyer who wants to receive the ownership rights. A purchase agreement should include the seller&#8217;s and buyer&#8217;s contact information, property description, purchase price, payment structure.</p> <p><a href="https://formspal.com/loan-agreement-template/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loan Agreement Template</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; this document is an essential legal tool to outline the terms between lending and borrowing parties. The agreement proves that the money is borrowed and not gifted and ensures the borrower will pay them back. A loan agreement will come in handy if a person plans to set up a business, buy expensive equipment, pay for the treatment, or cover the tuition.</span></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;">Bill of Sale Forms</h2> <p>On average, there are 1.88 vehicles per American household, which means that there are almost two buy-sell transactions between parties during the lifetime and US regulations require people to have a proper <a href="https://formspal.com/bill-of-sale/">bill of sale.</a></p> <p>We have put together a list of the most popular bill of sale templates (that are fillable, editable, and downloadable) to help you better handle the sales process and ownership transfer of your property.</p> <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Most Widely Used Bill of Sale Forms</h3> <p>A bill of sale serves as essential evidence and protection of the transaction between a seller and buyer. In many states, it&#8217;s required to sign a bill of sale, for example, to register a purchased car in the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). However, a bill of sale can be helpful not only to sell a used car but also to buy or purchase other types of vehicles (check our <a href="https://formspal.com/bill-of-sale/motor-vehicle-bill-of-sale/">vehicle bill of sale page</a>), items, and even boats. The forms below are the most widely used in the U.S. when it comes to recording a transaction.</p> <p>One of the most popular bill of sale forms is a <a href="https://formspal.com/bill-of-sale/boat-bill-of-sale/">Bill of Sale for Boat</a>. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA), sales of new powerboats in the U.S. increased in 2020 by around 12% compared to 2019. Outdoor activities are becoming more and more widespread due to the pandemic, so it&#8217;s quite an understandable trend. Thus, a boat bill of sale can come in handy when someone wants to discover the benefits of the open air by buying a personal watercraft.</p> <p>Another widely used bill of sale form is a <a href="https://formspal.com/bill-of-sale/trailer-bill-of-sale/">Bill of Sale for Trailer</a>. A trailer is any structure that can be pulled by a vehicle, for example, travel trailers or mobile homes, so it&#8217;s very convenient to have one in the garage. A trailer bill of sale is similar to motor vehicle and boat bills of sale, as it includes the same details such as vehicle identification number (VIN), make, model, and year of manufacturing.</p> <p>Some states, for example, Texas, require you to sign a bill of sale to buy or sell cars and boats. To prove that a transaction has taken place, a <a href="https://formspal.com/bill-of-sale/texas/">Texas Bill of Sale</a> must include the item&#8217;s description, condition, VIN or HIN (if it&#8217;s a car or boat), transaction date, purchase price, and the parties&#8217; contact information. Depending on a transaction type, a Texas bill of sale should be prepared along with the vessel, vehicle, or firearm registration forms.</p> <p>In Florida, you need to prepare and sign a <a href="https://formspal.com/bill-of-sale/florida/">Florida Bill of Sale</a> to legally record the item&#8217;s sale or purchase. The document should include the parties&#8217; names and addresses, item description, transaction date, and purchase amount. It&#8217;s necessary to prepare the specific bill of sale forms when buying or selling a motor vehicle, boat, or firearm. These forms should be supported by Florida vehicle or boat registration documents.</p> <p>If it&#8217;s necessary to prove a legal sale or purchase in Missouri, a <a href="https://formspal.com/bill-of-sale/missouri/">Missouri Bill of Sale</a> will ensure that the deal is finalized and secured. This document serves as a receipt of a transaction and should provide all details regarding a seller, buyer, item, purchase date, and price. In some cases, it&#8217;s necessary to notarize a bill of sale in Missouri, for example, when selling or buying a motor vehicle.</p> <h3 style="text-align: center;">State Bill of Sale Templates by Type</h3> <p>A bill of sale is not only a way to get receipts confirming transactions but also crucial evidence to avoid future misunderstandings. Each transaction type usually needs a specific bill of sale form. Some of them may have to be notarized and signed by both parties, and others may be legally required to prove the ownership change or register the vehicle. Sometimes, you know what bill of sale type you need but cannot find the form appropriate in the state you live in. Below you will find a list of all essential state bill of sale forms divided by types.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://formspal.com/bill-of-sale/alabama/alabama-boat-bill-of-sale/">Alabama Boat Bill of

<p>Bill of sale forms can be used for different purposes, from selling personal property, like furniture, to transferring the ownership of a used car, trailer, or boat. Depending on the state, their contents may vary a little.

In some cases, action could be taken to block sites without first allowing the alleged infringer to defend themselves in court.</p> <h4>H.R.3261 &#8211; Stop Online Piracy Act</h4> <p>This bill would establish a system for taking down websites that the Justice Department determines to be dedicated to copyright infringement. The DoJ or the copyright owner would be able to commence a legal action against any site they deem to have &#8220;only limited purpose or use other than infringement,&#8221; and the DoJ would be allowed to demand that search engines, social networking sites, and domain name services block access to the targeted site.

To that end, it includes a new government-run insurance plan (a.k.a. a public option) to compete with the private companies, a requirement that all Americans have health insurance, a prohibition on denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions and, to pay for it all, a surtax on households with an income above $350,000.</p> <p>America&#8217;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 sets forth provisions governing health insurance plans and issuers, including:</p> <ul> <li>exempting grandfathered health insurance coverage from requirements of this Act;</li> <li>prohibiting preexisting condition exclusions;</li> <li>providing for guaranteed coverage to all individuals and employers and automatic renewal of coverage;</li> <li>prohibiting premium variances, except for reasons of age, area, or family enrollment; and</li> <li>prohibiting rescission of health insurance coverage without clear and convincing evidence of fraud.</li> </ul> <h4>H.R.45 &#8211; Blair Holt&#8217;s Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009</h4> <p>The Blair Holt&#8217;s Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act would establish a nationwide system for prohibiting unlicensed gun ownership. If approved, the law would require gun owners to apply for five-year licenses to own firearms and would give the U.S. Attorney General broad authority over the program.</p> <p>Blair Holt&#8217;s Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit a person from possessing a firearm unless that person has been issued a firearm license under this Act or a state system certified under this Act and such license has not been invalidated or revoked.

For example, it would deny tax credits to companies that offer health plans that cover abortions and it would block anybody with insurance that covers abortions from receiving federal subsidies or medical cost tax deductions, even if the abortion portion is paid separately with personal funds. Women who use tax-free Medical Savings Accounts would have to pay taxes on the costs of abortions.</p> <p>No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act &#8211; Title I: Prohibiting Federally-Funded Abortions and Providing for Conscience Protections prohibits the expenditure of funds authorized or appropriated by federal law or funds in any trust fund to which funds are authorized or appropriated by federal law (federal funds) for any abortion.

The final version is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost $787 billion over the 2009-2019 period.</p> <p>The bill amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act and the Trade Act of 1974 to extend the deadline for payment of a crop insurance-related fee by producers who suffered the crop year 2008 losses in order to qualify for certain supplemental agricultural disaster assistance for the crop year 2008.
