Not complete, for sure -- lots of folks who are important to me aren't there -- but representative.\n\nOver the past decade plus, we've all gotten older and changed. Gotten married, had children, gotten divorced, changed jobs, started companies, changed the world.\n\nWhat I was struck by this year is how all these relationships have developed over the years. These are people who have seen each other at highs and lows; who have worked shoulder to shoulder with each other on too many projects to mention, and against each other on some, too.\n\nThe special thing about having that much context, and people around who know &amp; believe in you is how much they can frame the year that's past, and the year ahead.\n\nYour tribe has the context about you &amp; your life -- and can remind you, when you need it, of who you are, and who you can be.\n\nAnd beyond all that, it just feels good (and restorative, and challenging) to come home once a year, and see friends &amp; allies, and tell all the old jokes, and just listen about where you've each been, and plan about what's to come.\n\nI enter 2019 grateful for this communion and connection, and reminded again how important it is to find your people, and keep investing in them always.\n\nHappy 2019 everyone.\n",

				"content_text": "With the news of Robert Pirsig's death last week, I've picked up <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> to reread it. It was an important book to me growing up -- it helped me think through my own value system and also to think through technology and its relationship to ourselves and our communities.\n\nIt's a slower paced book from a slower paced time. It was originally published in 1974, when I was just 3 years old, and 2 years before Apple was founded.\n\nIt's a bit of a cliche (although true) to talk about how relevant books like Postman's <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death </em>&amp; <em>Technopoly, </em>McLuhan's<em> The Medium is the Message, </em>Orwell's <em>1984, </em>and Huxley's <em>Brave New World </em>are today -- but this book of Pirsig's seems (to me) to capture so much of the tension between technology &amp; progress &amp; self.\n\nI'll quote an early passage at length. The author is taking a cross country backroads motorcycle trip with some friends -- he is himself a very capable motorcycle mechanic and loves the work of keeping his bike running well. But he's puzzled by his friends' relationship with technology.\n\nLong passage follows. Pretty sure I'll post more as I slowly work my way through this rereading of the classic. Lots of these thoughts keep rattling around in my head days later.\n\nWhat is it they say about history? That it doesn't repeat but it often rhymes? I'm sure feeling that a lot these days, for better or worse.\n<blockquote>They [his friends] talk once in a while in as few pained words as possible about “it” or “it all” as in the sentence, “There is just no escape from it.” And if I asked, “From what?” the answer might be “The whole thing,” or “The whole organized bit,” or even “The system.” Sylvia once said defensively, “Well, you know how to cope with it,” which puffed me up so much at the time I was embarrassed to ask what “it” was and so remained somewhat puzzled. I thought it was something more mysterious than technology. But now I see that the “it” was mainly, if not entirely, technology. But, that doesn’t sound right either. The “it” is a kind of force that gives rise to technology, something undefined, but inhuman, mechanical, lifeless, a blind monster, a death force. Something hideous they are running from but know they can never escape. I’m putting it way too heavily here but in a less emphatic and less defined way this is what it is. Somewhere there are people who understand it and run it but those are technologists, and they speak an inhuman language when describing what they do. It’s all parts and relationships of unheard-of things that never make any sense no matter how often you hear about them. And their things, their monster keeps eating up land and polluting their air and lakes, and there is no way to strike back at it, and hardly any way to escape it. That attitude is not hard to come to. You go through a heavy industrial area of a large city and there it all is, the technology. In front of it are high barbed-wire fences, locked gates, signs saying No TRESPASSING, and beyond, through sooty air, you see ugly strange shapes of metal and brick whose purpose is unknown, and whose masters you will never see. What it’s for you don’t know, and why it’s there, there’s no one to tell, and so all you can feel is alienated, estranged, as though you didn’t belong there. Who owns and understands this doesn’t want you around. All this technology has somehow made you a stranger in your own land. Its very shape and appearance and mysteriousness say, “Get out.” You know there’s an explanation for all this somewhere and what it’s doing undoubtedly serves mankind in some indirect way but that isn’t what you see. What you see is the No TRESPASSING, KEEP OUT signs and not anything serving people but little people, like ants, serving these strange, incomprehensible shapes. And you think, even if I were a part of this, even if I were not a stranger, I would be just another ant serving the shapes. So the final feeling is hostile, and I think that’s ultimately what’s involved with this otherwise unexplainable attitude of John and Sylvia. Anything to do with valves and shafts and wrenches is a part of that dehumanized world, and they would rather not think about it. They don’t want to get into it. If this is so, they are not alone. There is no question that they have been following their natural feelings in this and not trying to imitate anyone. But many others are also following their natural feelings and not trying to imitate anyone and the natural feelings of very many people are similar on this matter; so that when you look at them collectively, as journalists do, you get the illusion of a mass movement, an antitechnological mass movement, an entire political antitechnological left emerging, looming up from apparently nowhere, saying, “Stop the technology. Have it somewhere else. Don’t have it here.” It is still restrained by a thin web of logic that points out that without the factories there are no jobs or standard of living. But there are human forces stronger than logic. There always have been, and if they become strong enough in their hatred of technology that web can break. Clichés and stereotypes such as “beatnik” or “hippie” have been invented for the antitechnologists, the antisystem people, and will continue to be. But one does not convert individuals into mass people with the simple coining of a mass term.</blockquote>\n",

DWNLD focused on offering a smart and easy way for publishers to build and maintain connections with their audiences through creating their own dedicated apps. When we first invested in <a href=\"https://news.greylock.com/our-investment-in-dwnld-efee9e280d8f#.gv2ihfvdg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DWNLD</a>, I said:\n<blockquote>So much has gotten better with mobile technology. Which makes it all the more painful when you come across the areas that have not yet caught up. It’s not easier or better to read things from our favorite publications or brands.</blockquote>\nDWNLD launched during the ascent of apps, but it became very clear during the following year that custom apps aren't the right solution for most professional publishers. But the pain point for publishers still exists: it's still very hard for anyone but the largest publishers to build and maintain a smart, dynamic home on the web. Today, publishers need to hack together a chaotic bundle of various plug-ins to help solve for optimization, engagement, SEO, and design. It's a burdensome process for even the most sophisticated publisher.\n\nThe DWNLD team saw these trends very clearly and so over the past year have built on their base technology for easy but powerful publishing (enabled by machine learning on the back end) and built something new. Today, they are introducing <a href=\"http://www.verst.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Verst</a> (the company and the product name), a new platform that’s purpose built for the unique needs of professional publishers.\n<figure><img src=\"http://exported.ver.st/hdd462/xrw4djfzefgqncgt42vh3eupugjlswnhr.jpeg\"><figcaption>AJ Frank, CEO</figcaption></figure>\nI won't spend a lot of time on the details of the product because CEO AJ Frank does a <a href=\"http://blog.verst.co/article/3205\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great job of detailing all the goodness here</a>. Beyond the elegant design, search engine optimization, and dedicated customer support that you’d expect, Verst adds a new layer of integrated machine learning and intelligence that’s simple and intuitive to use — it means that machines can help publishers deal with so much of the complexity that's painful today. In short, they are delivering on the same vision that initially convinced me to invest:\n<blockquote>It incorporates (and hides!) hugely sophisticated technology that analyzes and transforms web content into a first class, high performance native mobile experience, coupled with notifications, easy commerce options, and subscription capabilities built in.</blockquote>\nAJ is a talented entrepreneur with unique experience helping build and scale publishing platforms like YouTube and Vine. He brings a critical publisher orientation to the company and he will work hard every day to build and innovate on behalf of professional publishers. I am happy that the Verst team is launching today and sharing what they've been up to with the rest of the world. We look forward to continuing our partnership with AJ, Fritz (founder &amp; chairman) and the rest of the team as they continue to build Verst.\n\nP.S. - You might check out my partner Reid's new blog at <a href=\"http://www.reidhoffman.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reidhoffman.org</a> as well.\n\n<em>Also <a href=\"https://medium.com/@johnolilly/introducing-verst-publishing-with-power-62d276b808b4#.99p7q6g6h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published on Medium</a>.</em>\n",

				"content_text": "The other day I wrote a <a href=\"http://www.johnolilly.com/418-thoughts/2475-persist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post about how 2017 has felt to me so far and how I'm trying to manage my own psychology</a>.\n\nThis post isn't about that. This one is about what I'm actually paying attention to, and what I'm doing about it. (And what I'm trying not to focus on.)\n\n[Side note: I'm using the first person singular in this post, but a lot of it -- most, really -- is shared between Kathy &amp; me.]\n\nHere are the areas I'm thinking the most about (in no priority order):\n<ol>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Protecting people.</strong> Lots of categories, but in general, thinking about how we take the best care of our most vulnerable citizens and residents; people trying to build their lives, do their jobs, and contribute to society.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>How we govern.</strong> We've gotten ourselves to a place where we just aren't very good at governing to create the society that we want. Lots of things we can do here and should. One of the main ones, I think, is to work to strengthen local and state governments, who are stressed and underfunded -- but they're more human scale and understandable than our federal government is.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Jobs.</strong> Lots of things have changed in the USA over the last couple of decades, but I'm not sure that anything has changed as profoundly as the movement of economic opportunities into the cities and away from our rural areas. Economics and technology are likely to exacerbate the problem. But unless we figure out how to connect economic engines to more of our country, we won't find our way out of the situation we're in.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>The Media.</strong> The state of our media doesn't seem great. In lots of ways, reporting is more vital than ever. In lots of ways, the way we get and consume and understand our news is busted. This is the only category where I don't really have many ideas on what to do <em>right now </em>to help.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Candidates.</strong> This is more partisan/election oriented than I generally think of myself as caring about. But we need better candidates and we need to support them and help them win. I lean Democratic for lots of reasons right now, but have historically supported thoughtful candidates of all stripes.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Home &amp; Friends.</strong> Lots of people unsure what to do. Lots of people trying to act like everything's normal. Lots of people under real stress. And it's tricky to know even how to talk to our kids about what's happening.</li>\n</ol>\nClearly, this is way too much stuff to think about, let alone make a really meaningful commitment of time and resources too.\n\nSo, here's what we (Kathy &amp; I) are doing: we're picking a few (fewer than 5) things to really focus our time, effort &amp; expertise on. We're picking as many things to support financially in these areas of interest as we can, too. And then we're trying our best to stay focused on that set.\n\nAs for the things we're doing actively:\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<strong>I'm spending more time with Code for America.</strong> I believe in state &amp; local governments -- they're more human scale, more immediate, and in lots of ways, the problems are more addressable. I've been on the board for several years and am amping up my involvement -- this is my main commitment outside of my day job at Greylock and my family responsibilities.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>I'm looking for companies that can really address the jobs situation, especially outside of cities.</strong> Economics favor cities pretty clearly. And automation enabled by computing will ravage whole sectors of our traditional industries. It seems clear that fighting against manufacturing automation is a losing battle. But certain service sectors, enabled by computing, seem likely to drive jobs in the future. And investing in education to support this transition will be the work of a generation.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>We're trying to be as open and honest talking with our kids as we can.</strong> This one has been tough, honestly. Our kids can see our stress and distraction -- so we're trying to be honest about the situation as we see it, why we're stressed about it, and what we're doing. But we're also being clear with them that we're trying (with incomplete success) to defocus on the slings &amp; arrows of daily news, and instead focus on the things we want to build.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Some stuff related to candidates and helping the best ones get elected that I'm not really ready to get into much detail on yet.</strong> Real work to do here.</li>\n \t<li><strong>A couple of additional things that we can't talk about yet.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe things we're supporting financially:\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.codeforamerica.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>Code for America</strong></em></a> - as noted above.</li>\n \t<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.fightforthefuture.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>Fight for the Future</strong></em></a> - some of the very best defenders of values that I know.</li>\n \t<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>Union of Concerned Scientists</strong></em></a> - we've always needed scientists who are reflective and thoughtful about their place in and impact on our world. Now even more.</li>\n \t<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>Southern Poverty Law Center</strong></em></a> - more people need protecting than ever, unfortunately.</li>\n \t<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>ACLU</strong></em></a> - I never really thought of myself as someone who would want to support the ACLU -- partly because I grew up more conservative than I am now, but: thank goodness for the ACLU.</li>\n \t<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>Pro Publica</strong></em></a> - we need talented, aggressive, supported investigative journalists maybe more than we've ever needed them -- certainly in my lifetime.</li>\n</ul>\nThere's other stuff, too. Honestly lots of things falling on the floor. I'm trying to stay in touch with as many other folks who are working through these and other issues, too. Doing as much matchmaking as I can, too.\n\nBut these are the areas of focus that so far have made the most sense to Kathy &amp; me. Undoubtedly some will change, and some will increase.\n\nNone of this is as tight or focused as I'd like it to be. But that's just the reality of 2017.\n",

Just to be perfectly clear, Eric made the right call both times — Felix and Sandy were both amazing.

				"title": "Automation \u0026amp; The Cotton Gin",
				"content_html": "<p>My mom is visiting us this week and we were talking about machine learning and artificial intelligence — what it can do, what it probably can’t do, and implications. Because, you know, it’s 2016 and that’s what we talk about when we’re not talking about Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>(For whatever it’s worth, I’m kind of burying the lede on this one — long windup to get my way to conclusions. Sorry!)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I made an offhand comment to her that we’re in the very early days of this evolution — I wasn’t really talking about AI <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per se<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but more just about how software is running more and more of our world, and that’s a phenomenon that’s likely to accelerate, and for a long time — and that as a consequence, there’s going to be an increasing supply &amp; demand imbalance in software talent. We just don’t have enough talent to write all the systems that need to get written, and for the moment, that means that we’re getting profound concentrations of talent — especially in AI — at companies like Google, Facebook, Apple and others. I don’t really think that concentration of talent is a permanent state of affairs (and, in fact, my job is an explicit bet to the contrary), but it sure is true right now.</p>\n<p>As we were talking about all this, something else I’ve been mulling over for awhile finally clicked in my head, and that’s the story of the picture at the top of this post — that’s a picture my dad took in Quitman, Georgia, where he grew up, of his grandfather Pappy’s cotton gin.</p>\n<p>Here’s what my dad wrote recently about his recollections of the gin and his adventures in the 1950s:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>He wrote more about it — but in these few paragraphs you can see how much Dad learned about how things work from Pappy and the gin (and other unrelated engineering explorations).</p>\n<p>You can see, too, what an amazing system the cotton gin itself was, and how it changed the way people worked. The modern cotton gin was invented by Eli Whitney in 1793 (when George Washington was president!) more than 150 years before my dad got to explore Pappy’s.</p>\n<p>When the cotton gin was invented, many people thought that it would reduce our new nation’s dependence on slavery by removing the painstaking work of separating the usable cotton from seeds, hulls, stems, etc.</p>\n<p>But ironically, it resulted in the growth of slavery.</p>\n<p>The gin could process cotton so efficiently that more cotton goods could be produced, and it turned out that there was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->massive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> latent demand for cotton goods. So while the robots did indeed reduce the reliance on slaves to do the finishing work, they also increased demand for cotton, which resulted in many more cotton fields, and many more slaves to tend them.</p>\n<p>I don’t know enough history to know whether this was a core issue that led to our Civil War or just a contributing factor. Probably somewhere in between. But it took us more than 100 years to really process all the implications of just this one technology advance (and I think really you’d argue that we haven’t fully come to terms with them even today.)</p>\n<p>So you see where I’m going with this.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to our own era, and we’re working our way through software automation instead of cotton processing automation. And it seems obvious to me that as we’re making systems and processes easier and easier to automate, we’re also generating massive new previously latent demand for software driven systems.</p>\n<p>I’m not arguing at all that this will result in anything like the growth of slavery in the first half of the 19th century — more that we’re in a time of profound change. And that worries over whether robots will take all our jobs I think will prove to be ultimately misplaced. I think that if you look not just at the cotton gin, but most technology automation advances what you’ll find is that the demand for labor nearly always <!-- raw HTML omitted -->increases<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>So for my part, I’m not particularly worried that we’ll find ourselves in a world where there’s nothing to do.</p>\n<p>But the jobs will surely change, and we’ll need to learn how to do different types of things in our schools. And our society will change. There will be winners &amp; losers. There will be painful dislocations. There will be (more) clashes between technology &amp; policy.

				"content_text": "My mom is visiting us this week and we were talking about machine learning and artificial intelligence — what it can do, what it probably can’t do, and implications. Because, you know, it’s 2016 and that’s what we talk about when we’re not talking about Donald Trump.\n\n(For whatever it’s worth, I’m kind of burying the lede on this one — long windup to get my way to conclusions. Sorry!)\n\nAnyway, I made an offhand comment to her that we’re in the very early days of this evolution — I wasn’t really talking about AI <em>per se</em>, but more just about how software is running more and more of our world, and that’s a phenomenon that’s likely to accelerate, and for a long time — and that as a consequence, there’s going to be an increasing supply &amp; demand imbalance in software talent. We just don’t have enough talent to write all the systems that need to get written, and for the moment, that means that we’re getting profound concentrations of talent — especially in AI — at companies like Google, Facebook, Apple and others. I don’t really think that concentration of talent is a permanent state of affairs (and, in fact, my job is an explicit bet to the contrary), but it sure is true right now.\n\nAs we were talking about all this, something else I’ve been mulling over for awhile finally clicked in my head, and that’s the story of the picture at the top of this post — that’s a picture my dad took in Quitman, Georgia, where he grew up, of his grandfather Pappy’s cotton gin.\n\nHere’s what my dad wrote recently about his recollections of the gin and his adventures in the 1950s:\n<blockquote>Even cooler than the Texaco business, though, was the cotton gin. It was in a poor part of town, between the tobacco barns and the railroad. The cotton mill was in that part of town, too, but it had been closed for years by the time I was terrorizing Quitman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Pappy let me spend a lot of time in the gin, and it was a source of endless fascination, maybe in part because of the danger. Farmers would bring their cotton to the gin in open wagons, pulled by trucks, horses or mules, or even tractors. During the peak of the ginning season (late summer, I think), wagons would be lined up way down the street waiting to get into the gin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The gin could only take cotton from one wagon at a time, and I guess this was necessary because each farmer was paid by the weight of cotton ginned, and this must have been the way they knew who had which cotton. A gin worker stood in the wagon of cotton with a large (maybe 18” diameter) suction pipe and sucked up all of the cotton in each wagon. He’d move the pipe back and forth over the cotton in the wagon and also move it up and down. The cotton would go from there into the gin, to have the seeds removed then the other trash (hulls, stems, etc.) blown out, I think. The cotton fibers then were combed and cleaned over and over on giant rollers with combs over them, then sent to a giant press where they were made into bales which were probably 6 feet tall and maybe 4x4 at the base. They were stood on end because that’s how the press was oriented. The cotton would be blown into the press, which was a cage of strong vertical boards, and when it was filled, a pneumatic ram would compress the cotton, then rise back up. Then more cotton would be added until no more could be; it was compressed to its limit. There was a jute fabric wrapper, which was then somehow put around the bale, and metal straps were put around this and tightened. Then the pressure was released and the bale was pulled out onto the dock to be weighed and moved to the warehouse.</blockquote>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1002\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"768\"]<a href=\"https://johnolilly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/4pdpdw3id0pjxnt0amfnf1udcnhfr5sth.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1002 size-large\" src=\"https://johnolilly.micro.blog/uploads/2025/19d76403a3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"513\"></a> Photo by Janko Ferlic[/caption]\n\nHe wrote more about it — but in these few paragraphs you can see how much Dad learned about how things work from Pappy and the gin (and other unrelated engineering explorations).\n\nYou can see, too, what an amazing system the cotton gin itself was, and how it changed the way people worked. The modern cotton gin was invented by Eli Whitney in 1793 (when George Washington was president!) more than 150 years before my dad got to explore Pappy’s.\n\nWhen the cotton gin was invented, many people thought that it would reduce our new nation’s dependence on slavery by removing the painstaking work of separating the usable cotton from seeds, hulls, stems, etc.\n\nBut ironically, it resulted in the growth of slavery.\n\nThe gin could process cotton so efficiently that more cotton goods could be produced, and it turned out that there was <em>massive</em> latent demand for cotton goods. So while the robots did indeed reduce the reliance on slaves to do the finishing work, they also increased demand for cotton, which resulted in many more cotton fields, and many more slaves to tend them.\n\nI don’t know enough history to know whether this was a core issue that led to our Civil War or just a contributing factor. Probably somewhere in between. But it took us more than 100 years to really process all the implications of just this one technology advance (and I think really you’d argue that we haven’t fully come to terms with them even today.)\n\nSo you see where I’m going with this.\n\nFast forward to our own era, and we’re working our way through software automation instead of cotton processing automation. And it seems obvious to me that as we’re making systems and processes easier and easier to automate, we’re also generating massive new previously latent demand for software driven systems.\n\nI’m not arguing at all that this will result in anything like the growth of slavery in the first half of the 19th century — more that we’re in a time of profound change. And that worries over whether robots will take all our jobs I think will prove to be ultimately misplaced. I think that if you look not just at the cotton gin, but most technology automation advances what you’ll find is that the demand for labor nearly always <em>increases</em>.\n\nSo for my part, I’m not particularly worried that we’ll find ourselves in a world where there’s nothing to do.\n\nBut the jobs will surely change, and we’ll need to learn how to do different types of things in our schools. And our society will change. There will be winners &amp; losers. There will be painful dislocations. There will be (more) clashes between technology &amp; policy. It’ll take time for us to come to grips with these changes, and many people simply won’t ever adjust. The changes we’re going through are that fundamental and dislocating. There’ll be tone deaf Silicon Valley titans — same as ever. There’ll be tone deaf leaders in Sacramento and Washington and our governments — same as ever.\n\nAnd those are the narratives that are prevalent now: thoughtless Ayn Randian libertarians in Silicon Valley versus inept and hopeless government.\n\n<em>But here’s the really good news: the narratives are interesting and handy, but I don’t think particularly representative of where we are and where we’re heading. </em>Our industries and our government are not as homogeneous as the stories.\n\nWe’re learning how to talk about what’s happening — things like Tim O’Reilly’s WTF conference for example. And we’re learning how to govern in a technologically sophisticated way.\n\nIt’s happening at the federal level with the work of Megan Smith, our country’s CTO, and DJ Patil, Ed Felton and Alex Macgillivray, US Deputy CTOs, built on the excellent work of Todd Park and many others.\n\nAnd also at the state and local level, pioneered by many, but notably by Jennifer Pahlka and others at Code for America.\n\nUltimately, like other transitions of magnitude, this is going to take us generations to really &amp; truly sort out.

				"title": "Now Playing: Blitzscaling",
				"content_html": "<p>Last year at Stanford University, Reid Hoffman, Allen Blue, Chris Yeh &amp; I taught a class on entrepreneurship at Stanford called “Blitzscaling” — a strategy in which a company (most often technology companies here in San Francisco &amp; Silicon Valley) pursues unusually high rates of growth in a way that’s tactically inefficient in terms of capital and other resources, but strategically essential to capitalizing on a large and attractive market opportunity.</p>\n<p>The class went well, and included tons of amazing insights from guests like Eric Schmidt, Marissa Mayer, Reed Hastings and Sam Altman, plus many others.</p>\n<p>So today we’re making the entire course content — all 20 class lectures — available via podcast on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iTunes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SoundCloud<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pocket Casts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stitcher<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>[embed]<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/greylock-partners/blitzscaling-01-overview-of-the-five-stages-of-blitzscaling-1\">soundcloud.com/greylock-&hellip;</a>[/embed]</p>\n<p>“But wait!”, you think — it’s 2016 now — isn’t the era of crazy growth over? Aren’t we back to a more sober time?</p>\n<p>The recent turmoil in the markets that has affected many technology companies — both public and private — may indeed lead some to conclude that the aggressive pursuit of growth needs be restricted to buoyant markets. But even today, those who choose to limit their pursuit of growth to favorable market conditions are forgoing potentially valuable opportunities.</p>\n<p>The key nuance to keep in mind during these mixed market conditions is that a company’s rate of growth needs to be measured on a relative — rather than absolute — scale. In a rapidly growing market, a company that grows 100% per year might be losing share; during turbulent times, a company that grows 50% per year might be gaining enough share to achieve market dominance. You can successfully blitzscale in good times, and you can successfully blitzscale in bad times. But you can’t and probably shouldn’t blitzscale all the time.</p>\n<p>Companies should adopt a strategy of blitzscaling when tackling a market in which becoming the first player to achieve scale confers strong and lasting competitive advantages. Blitzscaling is unlikely to prove successful if another company has already achieved the “first-scaler” advantage, or if the market itself doesn’t offer compelling sources of lasting competitive advantages, such as network effects. During the Dot Com era, both Amazon and Yahoo attempted frontal assaults on eBay’s auction business, but the network effects of eBay’s two-sided marketplace of buyers and sellers meant that its first scaler advantage was too strong to overcome — and so eBay dominated their important market for decades.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;4608&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Photo from energepic.com[/caption]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nLots of mistakes get made for sure — some companies believe they’re in a winner take all space when it turns out they’re in a commodity space — in which case blitzscaling is a disastrous strategy to employ.</p>\n<p>Opportunity is the primary factor when considering whether to blitzscale.

				"content_text": "Last year at Stanford University, Reid Hoffman, Allen Blue, Chris Yeh &amp; I taught a class on entrepreneurship at Stanford called “Blitzscaling” — a strategy in which a company (most often technology companies here in San Francisco &amp; Silicon Valley) pursues unusually high rates of growth in a way that’s tactically inefficient in terms of capital and other resources, but strategically essential to capitalizing on a large and attractive market opportunity.\n\nThe class went well, and included tons of amazing insights from guests like Eric Schmidt, Marissa Mayer, Reed Hastings and Sam Altman, plus many others.\n\nSo today we’re making the entire course content — all 20 class lectures — available via podcast on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/greymatter/id1089013200?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/greylock-partners/sets/blitzscaling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://pca.st/9vWf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pocket Casts</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/greylock-partners/greymatter?refid=stpr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stitcher</a>.\n\n[embed][soundcloud.com/greylock-...](https://soundcloud.com/greylock-partners/blitzscaling-01-overview-of-the-five-stages-of-blitzscaling-1)[/embed]\n\n“But wait!”, you think — it’s 2016 now — isn’t the era of crazy growth over? Aren’t we back to a more sober time?\n\nThe recent turmoil in the markets that has affected many technology companies — both public and private — may indeed lead some to conclude that the aggressive pursuit of growth needs be restricted to buoyant markets. But even today, those who choose to limit their pursuit of growth to favorable market conditions are forgoing potentially valuable opportunities.\n\nThe key nuance to keep in mind during these mixed market conditions is that a company’s rate of growth needs to be measured on a relative — rather than absolute — scale. In a rapidly growing market, a company that grows 100% per year might be losing share; during turbulent times, a company that grows 50% per year might be gaining enough share to achieve market dominance. You can successfully blitzscale in good times, and you can successfully blitzscale in bad times. But you can’t and probably shouldn’t blitzscale all the time.\n\nCompanies should adopt a strategy of blitzscaling when tackling a market in which becoming the first player to achieve scale confers strong and lasting competitive advantages. Blitzscaling is unlikely to prove successful if another company has already achieved the “first-scaler” advantage, or if the market itself doesn’t offer compelling sources of lasting competitive advantages, such as network effects. During the Dot Com era, both Amazon and Yahoo attempted frontal assaults on eBay’s auction business, but the network effects of eBay’s two-sided marketplace of buyers and sellers meant that its first scaler advantage was too strong to overcome — and so eBay dominated their important market for decades.\n<figure>\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"4608\"]<img src=\"http://johnolilly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/jlt1v2oqmoz52esngaoljvuw3ttiaoqxe.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\"> Photo from energepic.com[/caption]</figure>\nLots of mistakes get made for sure — some companies believe they’re in a winner take all space when it turns out they’re in a commodity space — in which case blitzscaling is a disastrous strategy to employ.\n\nOpportunity is the primary factor when considering whether to blitzscale. It is only after a company discovers an untapped and attractive market opportunity where being first to scale confers lasting competitive advantage that it should attempt to ascertain whether it has the ability to access or acquire the capital and talent necessary to support a sustained blitzscaling campaign.\n\nDuring the depths of the Dot Com bust, Google followed the blitzscaling playbook by using a distribution deal with AOL to dramatically expand its AdWords business. The deal, first announced in May 2002, gave AOL an 85% share of the revenue generated by AOL searches powered by Google, with a guaranteed minimum of $150,000,000 per year.

We’re in an absolute golden age of software that helps us do things together. For the first time in 25 years, there’s a massive reinvention of how we create things together happening — really the first time since Office solidified into its (rough) current form in 1990 or so. From about 1990 to 2007, Microsoft held an absolute distribution advantage — because Windows was on virtually everyone’s computer (95%!), Office had an almost overwhelming bundling advantage. (Internet Explorer did as well, but for some different reasons, Firefox and then Chrome broke that stranglehold for the web in the 2nd half of the last decade.)</p>\n<p>But in 2007 we got iPhones and Androids, and Office no longer had the overwhelming distribution advantage they did before — we were all reading and creating on new screens running iOS &amp; Android.</p>\n<p>That move to new platforms also came with a new human behaviors and expectations: real time notifications, messaging, auto-saving to the cloud, focus on content rather than files, and a desire/demand for apps designed to fit the way we were living and working, rather than fitting the way we work to the way apps worked. And so we’ve been the happy beneficiaries of completely new systems like Slack &amp; Quip &amp; many other modern ways to create.</p>\n<p>In many ways, this orientation towards messaging and collaboration also mirrored the rise of open source and collaborative development, as more and more developers started using the systems and norms and tools of open source.</p>\n<p>I think we’re going to see a long boom in productivity software, including some things that look completely different than we’ve ever seen, truly matched to the capabilities of mobile &amp; cloud.</p>\n<p>So of course Figma’s exciting to me as it’s very in line with those trends.</p>\n<p>The second reason I’m excited about Figma’s launch is that interaction &amp; interface design is very near &amp; dear to my heart. Learning about design and HCI at Stanford changed my life — it moved me from focusing on computer architectures towards building things that humans wanted to use. And that led me to work at Apple and Mozilla and on many other adventures.</p>\n<p>But design has stayed stubbornly isolated — it hasn’t undergone the same collaboration revolutions that software development and office productivity have gone through — it’s remained, basically, single player while the rest of the world has moved towards collaboration.</p>\n<p>Some of that is intrinsic — designing, like coding, really, is an act of pure creation and constraints — of figuring out how to get artifact to match intent. And that very often takes place with just one human in the loop, at least for the critical parts of it.</p>\n<p>But I think a more fundamental reason that design has been solo is simply that the tools have been solo — they haven’t embraced the concepts of asyncrhonous open source collaboration, or of syncrhonous messaging. A lot of the reason for that is that it’s legitimately difficult to build systems that allow this type of creation from many people who aren’t staring at the same screen. You needed robust cloud technology; you needed something like the web, and you needed something like GPUs that the web could use to make everything sing.</p>\n<p>And you needed folks like Evan &amp; Dylan and the Figma team to put it all together in an exceptionally ambitious technology package that builds on the very best design traditions of Adobe (and more recently Sketch), but also opens up new areas for both asynchronous and synchronous collaboration.</p>\n<p>To my knowledge, there’s never been a system built quite like Figma.</p>\n<p>I think for some people this will be an obviously interesting &amp; exciting cliff to jump off. I think it’ll make other people uncomfortable, with images of design by committee and bosses looking over designers shoulders.</p>\n<p>It will definitely mean we need to figure some new things out in terms of how we work together. But we figured it out in other areas — with tools like Slack &amp; Github, with Quip &amp; Google Docs. I have pretty high confidence that we’ll figure it out with Figma and design, too.</p>\n<p>Our experience with Figma so far has been exactly that — that it’s shorted design feedback loops, that it’s productively gotten more people in each company understanding and appreciating design, and that it’s just helping make better products faster.</p>\n<p>So that’s why I’m excited, and so proud of what the team at Figma has built.</p>\n<p>Achievement unlocked: multiplayer design.</p>\n<p>Lots and lots of fun days and learning ahead.</p>\n",

And so we’ve been the happy beneficiaries of completely new systems like Slack &amp; Quip &amp; many other modern ways to create.\n\nIn many ways, this orientation towards messaging and collaboration also mirrored the rise of open source and collaborative development, as more and more developers started using the systems and norms and tools of open source.\n\nI think we’re going to see a long boom in productivity software, including some things that look completely different than we’ve ever seen, truly matched to the capabilities of mobile &amp; cloud.\n\nSo of course Figma’s exciting to me as it’s very in line with those trends.\n\nThe second reason I’m excited about Figma’s launch is that interaction &amp; interface design is very near &amp; dear to my heart. Learning about design and HCI at Stanford changed my life — it moved me from focusing on computer architectures towards building things that humans wanted to use. And that led me to work at Apple and Mozilla and on many other adventures.\n\nBut design has stayed stubbornly isolated — it hasn’t undergone the same collaboration revolutions that software development and office productivity have gone through — it’s remained, basically, single player while the rest of the world has moved towards collaboration.\n\nSome of that is intrinsic — designing, like coding, really, is an act of pure creation and constraints — of figuring out how to get artifact to match intent. And that very often takes place with just one human in the loop, at least for the critical parts of it.\n\nBut I think a more fundamental reason that design has been solo is simply that the tools have been solo — they haven’t embraced the concepts of asyncrhonous open source collaboration, or of syncrhonous messaging. A lot of the reason for that is that it’s legitimately difficult to build systems that allow this type of creation from many people who aren’t staring at the same screen. You needed robust cloud technology; you needed something like the web, and you needed something like GPUs that the web could use to make everything sing.\n\nAnd you needed folks like Evan &amp; Dylan and the Figma team to put it all together in an exceptionally ambitious technology package that builds on the very best design traditions of Adobe (and more recently Sketch), but also opens up new areas for both asynchronous and synchronous collaboration.\n\nTo my knowledge, there’s never been a system built quite like Figma.\n\nI think for some people this will be an obviously interesting &amp; exciting cliff to jump off. I think it’ll make other people uncomfortable, with images of design by committee and bosses looking over designers shoulders.\n\nIt will definitely mean we need to figure some new things out in terms of how we work together. But we figured it out in other areas — with tools like Slack &amp; Github, with Quip &amp; Google Docs. I have pretty high confidence that we’ll figure it out with Figma and design, too.\n\nOur experience with Figma so far has been exactly that — that it’s shorted design feedback loops, that it’s productively gotten more people in each company understanding and appreciating design, and that it’s just helping make better products faster.\n\nSo that’s why I’m excited, and so proud of what the team at Figma has built.\n\nAchievement unlocked: multiplayer design.\n\nLots and lots of fun days and learning ahead.\n",

YMMV. ☺]</em>\n<ol>\n \t<li>\n<strong>It is, fundamentally and essentially, just this: a wristwatch. </strong>If you’re someone who wants to wear a watch, this is a great one in many ways. If you’re someone who doesn’t want to wear a watch, this will not make your life better. In 2015, wearing a watch is a bit of an affectation — you have to want to have a watch on, you certainly don’t need one — and that’s true for this, too.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Notifications are great. </strong>They did a great job, although they probably should have defaulted everything as off instead of on. But notifications are great, and useful.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Input is a PITA. </strong>Tough to get input of any sort into the watch.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>But Siri is great. </strong>In my experience, Siri’s voice recognition is excellent, although the set of things it can do, like on the iPhone, is thin.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>The contexts where I can actually use Siri are virtually non-existent. </strong>Same issue I have with voice controlled UIs generally.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Glances are great. </strong>Really nice way to quickly interact with application information, and will be better when they allow apps to cache info.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>The glance “dock” UI, where you swipe between glances, won’t scale well at all. </strong>Obvious reasons. Maybe okay up to 10 glances, which might be too many anyway.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Custom watch faces will come, and have the potential to be awesome. </strong>App-specific information to the watch face will be super useful, and I predict developers will be insanely creative when they get to.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>The app platform is profoundly unfinished. </strong>I find apps, as opposed to glances or notifications, to be basically useless. The app home screen is a miserable exercise in tiny target tapping after random visual scanning — but we knew that the second Kevin Lynch demoed the interface back in October. It is just obviously the wrong UI in so many ways.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>But I’m </strong><strong>not sure apps really matter anyway. </strong>I have a sneaky suspicion that apps, beyond glances &amp; notifications &amp; poking information through to the watch face, will not be all that important for the watch. Even once it’s a ton faster. I just think interactions will be much, much lighter.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Communications is a top level item, and useful, but kinda wonky still. </strong>It’ll get better. And will be important.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Hardware is magnificent. </strong>Really an unbelievable job for a 1.0 product.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Interesting that you can configure it from your phone but not your laptop. </strong>Idle observation.</li>\n \t<li>\n<strong>The sensors are good, but not amazing. </strong>Once we get enough battery life to do continuous heart rate monitoring, in the watch and other devices, some very interesting things are gonna happen in population health.</li>\n</ol>\nFor whatever it’s worth, I like mine.

But: that bear can dance!\n\nAnyway, I know this won’t be a commonly held view, but I look at GDocs and see very clearly a transitional product, not one that will hold up well for the ages.\n\nLots of opportunity here.\n",

But at the same time you should be <em>relentless </em>in looking at the data on how people actually use what you’ve built, and you should be looking for things that show which assumptions you’ve made are wrong, because those are the clues to what can be made better. We all like to see all the up-and-to-the-right charts, and those are important. But they don’t help you get any better than you already are.\n\nI wish we taught more of this blend, because all of the products we use would get better.\n\nSo: design like you’re right; listen like you’re wrong.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_41028\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"768\"]<a href=\"https://johnolilly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ask.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-41028 size-large\" src=\"https://johnolilly.micro.blog/uploads/2025/74c61f2170.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\"></a> Photo by Jonathan Simcoe[/caption]\n",

				"content_html": "<p>We should all know how things work.</p>\n<p>Background: I wrote most of this essay about 4 years ago when the iPad first came out (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->here’s the original<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, although it will seem dated), but with the rise of efforts like Codecademy and Code.org, and my own sons growing up, I’ve been thinking more and more about technical literacy and how we can help more people understand how things work.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The thing that prompted me to write this piece initially was the launch of the iPad, and the conversations that it started about whether as a culture we’re headed towards permission-only innovation or not — my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ben wrote a piece about how he felt about it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and more broadly how he felt about the restrictions that Apple was putting on how people could build things for it. He felt a lot of the same things then that I felt, although I didn’t agree with all of them.</p>\n<p>But since that launch several years ago, many things have changed.</p>\n<p>Apple has opened up (slowly, carefully, probably not as much as they could or should, but nevertheless moving in a better direction). Kickstarter &amp; Indiegogo became enablers for a huge generation of hardware hacking &amp; helped products like the Oculus get into the world. Incubators like Highway 1 emerged. And the Maker movement got stronger &amp; stronger. It’s been an incredible renaissance, and I’m encouraged by it.</p>\n<p>For me, the essential point was — and remains — that we (Americans, netizens, techies, almost any grouping that I can think of that’s meaningful) are at our best when we are makers, when we tinker, when we invent. We’re at our best when we’re taking things apart — whether it’s technology, laws, organizations — twisting them around to see how they work, tweaking them this way and that, and eventually creating something new.</p>\n<p>Invention and entrepreneurship is at the heart of change and progress; hacking and tinkering is the thing that leads to that invention.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, what (still) worries me about the trajectory of computing is not so much the emergence of tightly-controlled, non-tinkerable boxes, but the presumption that “normal people” don’t ever want to tinker, don’t want to be bothered with understanding how things work. I think it’s not true, really — certainly not for everyone — but I even think that this distinction between “normal people” and “tinkerers” or “techies” or “makers” is bogus at best, and really dangerously corrosive at worst.</p>\n<p>Here’s a little bit of a story about my own background and evolution as an engineer, and how that happened at all.</p>\n<p>When I was growing up, I remember my dad futzing around with everything. I remember him having a workshop in each of the houses we lived in (we moved around every few years as the Air Force stationed him in different places). I remember him working on our cars, our plumbing, and on our electrical systems in every house, on appliances, everything. I remember we seem to have built a deck for every house we ever lived in. He was just constantly working on building &amp; taking apart &amp; understanding &amp; rebuilding. Not to mention repairing a bunch of things that his knucklehead sons broke from time to time.</p>\n<p>But I have this especially strong memory that until I was probably 10 or 11, every television we bought would come in a kit, as a box full of parts, that Dad would put together — it was always a project for him. Now, as a kid, having a Heathkit television was basically mortifying. I mean, I just wanted us to go buy a “normal” television at Sears like everyone else did. Our TV didn’t look like other folks, and being different as a kid is always a tough feeling.</p>\n<p>And, in fact, our first computer was a Sinclair Z-80 that, you guessed it, came in a kit. Then, since there was no prepackaged software to run on it, I typed in a bunch of BASIC programs from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BYTE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> magazine. Good times.</p>\n<p>The benefits of having that awkward feeling as a kid, though, have been profound and long-lasting. The upside is that I’ve never really viewed technology as something that was magic. It always had components that added up to the whole, that you could replace, that you could mix in different ways. I’ve always felt like technology (and organizations, and laws, and most everything else) comes to us in a way that we should be poking at it, thinking about how things work, wondering how to make things better, wondering what would happen if you removed certain things.</p>\n<p>I think people will say to me: “Well, of course. You’re (at least trained as!) an engineer; you’re a tinkerer. That’s what engineers do — normal people don’t assume they can rewire their house, or swap out a power supply on their TV or change the way an operating system works.”</p>\n<p>But I think that’s bogus. It’s not like I was born an engineer — the instinct to fiddle with things isn’t something we’re born with. I became a tinkerer because I was exposed to surfaces that allowed — that invited — it. I figured out that I liked tweaking and building and creating because I got a bunch of chances to do that stuff, from hardware to software and everything in between. I knew I could do it because Dad modeled that behavior, but also because the stuff we had around the house was inspectable and malleable.</p>\n<p>Don’t misunderstand: I don’t think it’s a real problem that I can’t change the capacitors in my television today — I think that the most interesting surfaces for tinkering tend to evolve over time — and today the primary tinkering substrates appear to me to be the web, mobile interfaces, and, happily, hardware itself.</p>\n<p>But what I worry the most about is a cultural problem: the idea that there’s a split between the people who make the things in our world and the people who don’t — the ones who just consume/use/buy them. Go to any cafe in San Francisco or Palo Alto or New York, and it’s full of builders and makers. What an incredible development &amp; evolution.</p>\n<p>And I’m still worried that because of the ubiquity of the makers here (“here” meaning the broader technology community, not just SF &amp; Palo Alto), we can’t see the split that’s growing between makers &amp; non-makers, between the insiders &amp; the outsiders.</p>\n<p>The thing that I’m worried about is this feeling that seems to be growing in technology communities that “normal people” — these non-tinkerers — don’t want to tweak things, shouldn’t be allowed to tweak things, can’t be trusted with technical matters. Many will choose not to, I completely agree.

				"content_text": "We should all know how things work.\n\nBackground: I wrote most of this essay about 4 years ago when the iPad first came out (<a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2010/03/23/kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here’s the original</a>, although it will seem dated), but with the rise of efforts like Codecademy and Code.org, and my own sons growing up, I’ve been thinking more and more about technical literacy and how we can help more people understand how things work.\n<figure><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://johnolilly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pjwrusx4jcet33qylbykgtw4af0zfllpw.jpeg\" width=\"333\" height=\"248\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\nI’ll explain the significance of the picture later, but for now, here’s the background: it’s me, on a Christmas morning a long time ago, in the basement of the Rome, NY house where we lived. Obviously, I’m adorable, but that’s not my point right now. The more important feature of the picture is the television at the right — it’s a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heathkit</a>, and I’ll talk about it more below.\n\nThe thing that prompted me to write this piece initially was the launch of the iPad, and the conversations that it started about whether as a culture we’re headed towards permission-only innovation or not — my friend <a href=\"http://benfry.com/writing/archives/608\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ben wrote a piece about how he felt about it</a>, and more broadly how he felt about the restrictions that Apple was putting on how people could build things for it. He felt a lot of the same things then that I felt, although I didn’t agree with all of them.\n\nBut since that launch several years ago, many things have changed.\n\nApple has opened up (slowly, carefully, probably not as much as they could or should, but nevertheless moving in a better direction). Kickstarter &amp; Indiegogo became enablers for a huge generation of hardware hacking &amp; helped products like the Oculus get into the world. Incubators like Highway 1 emerged. And the Maker movement got stronger &amp; stronger. It’s been an incredible renaissance, and I’m encouraged by it.\n\nFor me, the essential point was — and remains — that we (Americans, netizens, techies, almost any grouping that I can think of that’s meaningful) are at our best when we are makers, when we tinker, when we invent. We’re at our best when we’re taking things apart — whether it’s technology, laws, organizations — twisting them around to see how they work, tweaking them this way and that, and eventually creating something new.\n\nInvention and entrepreneurship is at the heart of change and progress; hacking and tinkering is the thing that leads to that invention.\n\nIn a nutshell, what (still) worries me about the trajectory of computing is not so much the emergence of tightly-controlled, non-tinkerable boxes, but the presumption that “normal people” don’t ever want to tinker, don’t want to be bothered with understanding how things work. I think it’s not true, really — certainly not for everyone — but I even think that this distinction between “normal people” and “tinkerers” or “techies” or “makers” is bogus at best, and really dangerously corrosive at worst.\n\nHere’s a little bit of a story about my own background and evolution as an engineer, and how that happened at all.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I remember my dad futzing around with everything. I remember him having a workshop in each of the houses we lived in (we moved around every few years as the Air Force stationed him in different places). I remember him working on our cars, our plumbing, and on our electrical systems in every house, on appliances, everything. I remember we seem to have built a deck for every house we ever lived in. He was just constantly working on building &amp; taking apart &amp; understanding &amp; rebuilding. Not to mention repairing a bunch of things that his knucklehead sons broke from time to time.\n\nBut I have this especially strong memory that until I was probably 10 or 11, every television we bought would come in a kit, as a box full of parts, that Dad would put together — it was always a project for him. Now, as a kid, having a Heathkit television was basically mortifying. I mean, I just wanted us to go buy a “normal” television at Sears like everyone else did. Our TV didn’t look like other folks, and being different as a kid is always a tough feeling.\n\nAnd, in fact, our first computer was a Sinclair Z-80 that, you guessed it, came in a kit. Then, since there was no prepackaged software to run on it, I typed in a bunch of BASIC programs from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_%28magazine%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BYTE</a> magazine. Good times.\n\nThe benefits of having that awkward feeling as a kid, though, have been profound and long-lasting. The upside is that I’ve never really viewed technology as something that was magic. It always had components that added up to the whole, that you could replace, that you could mix in different ways. I’ve always felt like technology (and organizations, and laws, and most everything else) comes to us in a way that we should be poking at it, thinking about how things work, wondering how to make things better, wondering what would happen if you removed certain things.\n\nI think people will say to me: “Well, of course. You’re (at least trained as!) an engineer; you’re a tinkerer. That’s what engineers do — normal people don’t assume they can rewire their house, or swap out a power supply on their TV or change the way an operating system works.”\n\nBut I think that’s bogus. It’s not like I was born an engineer — the instinct to fiddle with things isn’t something we’re born with. I became a tinkerer because I was exposed to surfaces that allowed — that invited — it. I figured out that I liked tweaking and building and creating because I got a bunch of chances to do that stuff, from hardware to software and everything in between. I knew I could do it because Dad modeled that behavior, but also because the stuff we had around the house was inspectable and malleable.\n\nDon’t misunderstand: I don’t think it’s a real problem that I can’t change the capacitors in my television today — I think that the most interesting surfaces for tinkering tend to evolve over time — and today the primary tinkering substrates appear to me to be the web, mobile interfaces, and, happily, hardware itself.\n\nBut what I worry the most about is a cultural problem: the idea that there’s a split between the people who make the things in our world and the people who don’t — the ones who just consume/use/buy them. Go to any cafe in San Francisco or Palo Alto or New York, and it’s full of builders and makers. What an incredible development &amp; evolution.\n\nAnd I’m still worried that because of the ubiquity of the makers here (“here” meaning the broader technology community, not just SF &amp; Palo Alto), we can’t see the split that’s growing between makers &amp; non-makers, between the insiders &amp; the outsiders.\n\nThe thing that I’m worried about is this feeling that seems to be growing in technology communities that “normal people” — these non-tinkerers — don’t want to tweak things, shouldn’t be allowed to tweak things, can’t be trusted with technical matters. Many will choose not to, I completely agree. But we shouldn’t presume such.\n\nWhen people talk about coding literacy or technical literacy, what I hear &amp; think is not necessarily that everyone will code in the future, but that we want more people exposed to understanding a bit about how things work, and see paths for themselves that are natural &amp; inclusive, as opposed to alien and forbidding.\n\nWe all have the potential inside us to make things. But we’re not born into the world as makers — the world around us — the people in it and the artifacts in it — help us to discover what we can be.\n",

I stopped caring so much about the things we were making, and started caring a lot more about the things that we wanted to do with them, or really more broadly, with, in &amp; around them.</p>\n<p>Mitch had, in 1991 — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->before the advent of the web &amp; the browser<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — three profound insights.</p>\n<p>First, along the lines of McLuhan and many others before him, it was clear to him, even in a pre-Netscape world, that technology wasn’t just riding alongside of or on top of culture, but was becoming mainstream culture. Even today I’m not sure everyone internalizes that, although it’s becoming harder and harder not to see.</p>\n<p>Second, he articulated that like buildings need architects — for taking into account the human needs of a building, rather than purely engineering concerns—software would also need them, not just in the sense of technical architects, but really in the sense of design thinkers.

				"content_text": "Take a look at this quote, from my very good friend &amp; mentor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mitch Kapor</a>:\n<blockquote><em>The great and rapid success of the personal computer industry over the past decade is not without its unexpected ironies. What began as a revolution of individual empowerment has ended with the personal computer industry not only joining the computing mainstream, but in fact defining it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>Despite the enormous outward success of personal computers, the daily experience of using computers far too often is still fraught with difficulty, pain, and barriers for most people, which means that the revolution, measured by its original goals, has not as yet succeeded.</em></blockquote>\nI look at this and think about these words and ideas a lot.\n\nHere’s the kicker: he <em>wrote this in 1991</em>, nearly 25 years ago.\n\nHe wrote it as part of an essay for a nerd magazine that only a few of you will remember called Dr. Dobb’s Journal —<a href=\"http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/1-kapor.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> here’s the whole essay</a>, as repurposed for Terry Winograd’s book <em>Bringing Design to Software.</em>\n\nI can’t overstate how much Mitch’s essay changed my life. I was an undergrad at Stanford, mostly focused on computer architectures and how to make more &amp; more electrons do things for us faster &amp; faster.\n\nBut then I read this and everything changed. I stopped caring so much about the things we were making, and started caring a lot more about the things that we wanted to do with them, or really more broadly, with, in &amp; around them.\n\nMitch had, in 1991 — <em>before the advent of the web &amp; the browser</em> — three profound insights.\n\nFirst, along the lines of McLuhan and many others before him, it was clear to him, even in a pre-Netscape world, that technology wasn’t just riding alongside of or on top of culture, but was becoming mainstream culture. Even today I’m not sure everyone internalizes that, although it’s becoming harder and harder not to see.\n\nSecond, he articulated that like buildings need architects — for taking into account the human needs of a building, rather than purely engineering concerns—software would also need them, not just in the sense of technical architects, but really in the sense of design thinkers. On a personal note, once I read that, and thought about it, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. For me, it just changed everything in my perspective.\n\nBut mostly, and crucially, he pointed out that our software and systems were mostly not delivering on the promise. (It’s an aside, but for those of you who are interested in the real origins of the movement towards personal empowerment from personal computers, I highly recommend John Markoff’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Dormouse_Said\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>What the Dormouse Said</em></a>.)\n\nSo I think about this evolution a lot. And as I write today, it’s so clear that we’ve made so much progress since Mitch wrote this in 1991. People (generally) know what design can do and how important it can be (although we have a long way to go on this front, still.) Individuals are so empowered from their phones and tablets, wherever they are, all the time: from a cafe or from Ferguson, from a tiny startup crammed into a loft to while you’re walking down the street. We’ve delivered on so much of the promise.\n\nAnd yet: when we get a little outside of our Silicon Valley/SF/NYC/Berlin/etc bubble, it’s just so obvious that there’s so much left to do, so much coming.\n\nAlong these lines, I <em>love </em>Kevin Kelly’s essay <a href=\"https://medium.com/message/you-are-not-late-b3d76f963142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You Are Not Late</a>. Go read it.\n\nWe have entered a time of permanent, frenetic, technology-led but human-centered revolution. There’s never, ever been a better time to go make the world you want.\n\n<em>(Photo by James Pond)</em>\n",

Mobile discovery and acquisition is a mess — it’s in a ‘pre-pagerank’ phase where we lack the right tools and paths to find and discover content and services efficiently. Social apps may well be a major part of this, as I discussed in detail here. These apps have the opportunity to be a third channel in parallel to Google and Facebook.</blockquote>\nIt’s such an important notion that I’ll reemphasize the important part here:\n<blockquote><strong><em>[mobile] is in a ‘pre-pagerank’ phase where we lack the right tools and paths to find and discover content and services efficiently.</em></strong></blockquote>\nThat’s it.

Talk about the parts of what you’re doing that are the most exciting to you! And in general, it’s probably best not to just jump into a PowerPoint deck. Take a few minutes to introduce yourself, and hear a bit from who you’re seeing. Don’t get too informal, of course – you’re still in a business context – but try to interact in as authentic a working style as you can.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seek out investors who lean forward<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who engage, who ask you tough questions. Tough questions aren’t always fun, but they’re ultimately what makes your company better.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You should ask questions, too, particularly to understand how the investor thinks about businesses like yours.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I personally love getting questions and like a spirited debate. Helps us get to know each other.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Be resilient. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A “no” from a few partners or firms doesn’t mean you won’t get funded. As mentioned above, a lot of times it’s context.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Be persistent.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> A “no” on this round doesn’t mean that an investor won’t be better, or more able to work on your company in the next round.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember that relationships are progressions.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Don’t read too much into any particular interaction. Some investors ask a bunch of questions in first meetings. Some listen more and engage more as the process goes on. Everyone is different. When in doubt about what they’re thinking, ask!</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Above all, don’t think of fundraising as a transaction to get finished and move onto the next thing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It is important to get the funding you need, but you’ll live with your investor for the life of your startup (and really beyond, relationship-wise). Think about it like the balancing act when you’re trying both to attract and evaluate an all-star member of your team.</p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary, of course. But hopefully this bit of context will make the difference for you between just a pitch meeting and the start of a world-changing new relationship.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Lilly is a partner at Greylock Partners.

After nearly 20 years of operating at places like Mozilla, Reactivity, Trilogy &amp; Apple, I still tend to think like an entrepreneur myself, so some of the assumptions of life inside a VC are maybe a little more obvious to me than folks who have been around longer.\n\nSo here are some observations about my first year of VC life, and then some of the ways that being on the “inside” has changed the way I think that entrepreneurs should think about approaching investors – things I wish I had understood myself when I was pitching.\n\n<strong>A Year of Observations about VC Life </strong>\n\n<strong><em>Life as a VC is a sea of meetings.</em></strong> Really, it is a <em>lot </em>of meetings. Most of them are single meetings, with no follow-ups. Most don’t result in an investment in a company at all. In 2011 I had first meetings with just over 350 companies, plus another 100 more as parts of business plan judging and demo days. Those meetings resulted in just four investments for me (Tumblr, Dropbox, Clearslide and Citrus Lane) plus a handful of seed investments.\n\nThat’s a massive “bias-to-no” for any profession – 99% or so. It’s a tough negative bias, and every investor I know is affected by it in some way. But that one percent is like a lightning strike: those meetings can form the basis for some of the most interesting and meaningful work you’ll ever do.\n\n<strong><em>High fidelity communication is impossible. </em></strong>Because so many meetings are one-offs like I described, it’s very hard to communicate effectively. As an operator, you get good at being direct with the people you work with – or you fail.\n\nIn the context of a startup, relationships are developed over a period of months or years, so that candor can be better understood and more nuanced, resulting in communications that are efficient and effective, without hurt feelings from misunderstandings.\n\nVenture meetings aren’t like that. They’re incredibly overloaded: you’re trying to have a really good communication about who you are, what you’ve built, and how you want to grow. And you’re trying to do it in what is very often an extremely emotionally significant context of someone putting everything at risk to change the world. All with no existing relationship context to fall back on.\n\nAs an investor, I feel that a situation like that deserves my fullest possible attention, and my best questions about and suggestions for the business. But since we’ve never interacted before, there’s the danger of seeming too harsh in cases like that – we don’t have the shared context, vocabulary and trust frameworks in place that you do in longer term relationships. I think that’s why so many investors are often vague or non-responsive in their interactions afterwards – something I’ve tried very hard to avoid, although with imperfect success so far.\n\n<strong><em>Timing is everything, and everyone is multi-tasking. </em></strong>This applies to both the startup and the investor I’ve found – because each has their own set of work going, and any number of competing projects and priorities. The right thing coming by at the wrong time can be as challenging as an investment that just isn’t a natural fit. Life as a VC has different patterns and rhythms than life for operators – the nature of VC work is that you’ve got multiple companies and entrepreneurs you’re working with all the time, plus a constant stream of new folks to meet, and often in wildly different domains.\n\nThis means constant context switching, and there are times when excellent entrepreneurs and startups come through when it’s just hard or impossible to take focus from existing or in process investments. That creates a severe asymmetry: as an entrepreneur, you’re thinking about <em>one </em>thing (broadly defined as your startup), deeply,<em>all the time, </em>while investors that you’re talking with are trying to juggle many at once.\n\n<strong><em>Venture firms and partners are idiosyncratic and highly personal.</em></strong><em> </em>When I raised money for my own startup, I didn’t know much about how to think about approaching VCs. I knew folks at various firms, and mostly went to talk with those who I knew and then went through their process over the subsequent several weeks. I figured that VCs were all mostly similar to each other.\n\nI’ll say candidly that in my case, I was <em>extremely</em> lucky when that “strategy” worked – my investors were Mitch Kapor and Peter Fenton when they were both at Accel Partners – they were incredibly great for us, and I’ve had fantastically productive relationships with both for more than a decade now. But at some level it was really just dumb luck. I could easily have found a firm and partners who wouldn’t have worked.\n\nEvery firm has different culture: some are collaborative, others more solo practices; a small few (including Greylock) consist of former or current entrepreneurs, other firms consist of people who have been investors most of their careers; some are progressive, some are conservative. And even in partnerships, everyone there is different. Different in interests, skills, capabilities, stage in life, and temperament, at the very least.\n\nBut here’s the thing:<em> meeting with an amazing entrepreneur can change your whole year. </em>\n\nThat’s why you do it.

There’s no more optimistic and hopeful endeavor, and it’s 100% addictive.\n\n<strong>Suggestions on Interacting with VCs</strong>\n\nGiven that context on what it’s like to be on the inside of a VC firm, here are some things I wish I had understood when I pitched myself.\n<ol>\n \t<li>\n<strong>Be human; be yourself.</strong> Be prepared and have a pitch, but be willing to go off script.

				"content_html": "<p>The best thing about writing for me is that it helps me figure out what I really think about things. And one of the very best things about doing it on the web is that others can collaborate, disagree, tweak, suggest, and generally help think through things even better. So after a couple of days of Friday’s SOPA post rolling around in my head, I think I have a tighter point of view now that I wanted to write down. (There were some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tweets, mails, comments &amp; posts in reaction to what I wrote. Super thoughtful &amp; useful.</p>\n<p>Here are a few specific starting points, then I’ll get to my main point, which is that we (a technologically-oriented US, at least) are not well set up for the future in terms of how we evolve tech policy. Not a new thought, but I think the SOPA situation may be putting us in a worse spot.</p>\n<p>But first 3 starting points and a personal observation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->SOPA+PIPA are awful bills. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No way around it. They over-reach, they circumscribe civil liberties, and they mostly will not work. They shouldn’t pass, and we should do whatever we can to keep that from happening.

They’re so numerous in US history they hardly need listing here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Existing industries are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always <!-- raw HTML omitted -->oriented towards self-preservation. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No exception here. But there’s a funny thing that happens: the most progressive companies of today who become successful and dominant will become reactionary in the future, oriented themselves towards self-preservation. Same as it ever was. And you can see it even in the current situation — the companies who are most outspoken are the modern Internet companies: LinkedIn, Mozilla, Zynga, Google, etc etc. Mostly on the sidelines are the most progressive technology companies of the past decades, even including Apple. So this is not, fundamentally, a techie v content type of issue at all, but more of a progressive v conservative technology issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We do have existing laws and norms. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A number of folks argued that content owners just need to accept that pirated goods are a viable alternative and need to learn how to compete with them. I’m wholly unpersuaded by that point of view. Or, rather, I believe we do have existing laws that govern how we behave. It’s pretty clear (to me at least) that content businesses will need to evolve, and many interesting ones already have. But that’s something for a lawful market to decide, not for anyone to thrust onto content owners &amp; creators.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And then a personal observation: I was actually a little nervous writing about SOPA last week because of the tone of the conversation to date. I felt like it might actually provoke harsh negative reaction and somehow brand me as “SOPA-friendly” or against the web. That’s a weird thing for me to feel, as I think my web &amp; open culture <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bona fides <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are pretty well established at this point between my work with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PCF<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Code for America<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tumblr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc etc. That by itself tells me that there’s something wrong about how things are going.</p>\n<p>Okay, so given all that as a context, here’s my main point: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no matter what outcome we get to with respect to SOPA+PIPA, we’re in a bad spot going forward. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>I think much of the legitimate frustration on the Silicon Valley side of the fence is that there seems to be no way to have a meaningful conversation about this stuff in ways that we know to be productive. It’s happening at this point with some guy who doesn’t seem to understand technology having his staff &amp; a bunch of lobbyists prepare a non-sensical bill and then try to jam it through Congress, without any real effort to understand what might actually work. (And, worse, it’s being done in a way that seems deliberately designed to misinform.) So it’s a bunch of backroom, captured discussion that has massive impact on how we live our lives — and it’s all completely opaque (at best).</p>\n<p>The real thing that I’m worrying more and more about is not SOPA <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per se, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->although that’s a very large problem itself. The real problem that I see is that our government just isn’t set up to make meaningful technology policy decisions going forward. I think Larry Lessig would argue that that’s now true about all facets of modern life, but I think that with technology it’s significantly worse. We have massive interconnectedness of systems built on an extremely rapidly changing foundation of technology. But more than that, technology is now transforming our private and public lives so quickly that we can hardly make sense of any of it at a personal level, let alone a public policy level. And there seems to be no way for legislation to keep pace unless we change the discussion there from specific technologies instead to principles of how we want to build and evolve our society.</p>\n<p>And I just don’t see how that kind of conversation can happen right now.</p>\n<p>I see how to defeat SOPA, more or less. But it’s more lobbying, more rhetoric, more Capitol Hill influence. And I think that all of that stuff ultimately corrupts industries that use it. I know this is not a new objection, and I’m sure that there have been people in every industry forever who have made this point.</p>\n<p>So I think most of what I wanted to write on Friday is this: I desperately hope we can (1) defeat SOPA and more importantly (2) figure out a way to have useful technology policy discussions that can inform both our legistatures and law enforcement agencies. This isn’t the last law that will be technically poor and will impinge on civil liberties. There will be more, and they’ll come up more and more frequently as increasing portions of our society get disoriented by and disrupted by new technology.</p>\n<p>We shouldn’t rely on symmetric (and corrupting) lobbying efforts to make things better; we’ll just get more of the same crummy situation we’ve got.</p>\n<p>What I think we really need to figure out is how to help our leadership in government act and think in a more agile way, informed by more of our citizenry. More like the web, in a lot of ways. (Ed Lee’s announcement of an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SF partnership with Code for America<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a start.)</p>\n<p>Maybe impossible, a pipe dream. But that’s the target I think we should be setting for ourselves, not just defeating a crappy, misinformed bill.</p>\n<p>Photo by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Markus Spiske<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

But that’s something for a lawful market to decide, not for anyone to thrust onto content owners &amp; creators.\n\nAnd then a personal observation: I was actually a little nervous writing about SOPA last week because of the tone of the conversation to date. I felt like it might actually provoke harsh negative reaction and somehow brand me as “SOPA-friendly” or against the web. That’s a weird thing for me to feel, as I think my web &amp; open culture <em>bona fides </em>are pretty well established at this point between my work with <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mozilla</a>, <a href=\"http://pculture.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PCF</a>, <a href=\"http://www.codeforamerica.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Code for America</a>, and now <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tumblr</a>, etc etc. That by itself tells me that there’s something wrong about how things are going.\n\nOkay, so given all that as a context, here’s my main point: <em>no matter what outcome we get to with respect to SOPA+PIPA, we’re in a bad spot going forward. </em>\n\nI think much of the legitimate frustration on the Silicon Valley side of the fence is that there seems to be no way to have a meaningful conversation about this stuff in ways that we know to be productive. It’s happening at this point with some guy who doesn’t seem to understand technology having his staff &amp; a bunch of lobbyists prepare a non-sensical bill and then try to jam it through Congress, without any real effort to understand what might actually work. (And, worse, it’s being done in a way that seems deliberately designed to misinform.) So it’s a bunch of backroom, captured discussion that has massive impact on how we live our lives — and it’s all completely opaque (at best).\n\nThe real thing that I’m worrying more and more about is not SOPA <em>per se, </em>although that’s a very large problem itself. The real problem that I see is that our government just isn’t set up to make meaningful technology policy decisions going forward. I think Larry Lessig would argue that that’s now true about all facets of modern life, but I think that with technology it’s significantly worse. We have massive interconnectedness of systems built on an extremely rapidly changing foundation of technology. But more than that, technology is now transforming our private and public lives so quickly that we can hardly make sense of any of it at a personal level, let alone a public policy level. And there seems to be no way for legislation to keep pace unless we change the discussion there from specific technologies instead to principles of how we want to build and evolve our society.\n\nAnd I just don’t see how that kind of conversation can happen right now.\n\nI see how to defeat SOPA, more or less. But it’s more lobbying, more rhetoric, more Capitol Hill influence. And I think that all of that stuff ultimately corrupts industries that use it. I know this is not a new objection, and I’m sure that there have been people in every industry forever who have made this point.\n\nSo I think most of what I wanted to write on Friday is this: I desperately hope we can (1) defeat SOPA and more importantly (2) figure out a way to have useful technology policy discussions that can inform both our legistatures and law enforcement agencies. This isn’t the last law that will be technically poor and will impinge on civil liberties. There will be more, and they’ll come up more and more frequently as increasing portions of our society get disoriented by and disrupted by new technology.\n\nWe shouldn’t rely on symmetric (and corrupting) lobbying efforts to make things better; we’ll just get more of the same crummy situation we’ve got.\n\nWhat I think we really need to figure out is how to help our leadership in government act and think in a more agile way, informed by more of our citizenry. More like the web, in a lot of ways. (Ed Lee’s announcement of an <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2012%2F01%2F06%2FBUCB1MLF3F.DTL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SF partnership with Code for America</a> is a start.)\n\nMaybe impossible, a pipe dream. But that’s the target I think we should be setting for ourselves, not just defeating a crappy, misinformed bill.\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Markus Spiske</a>\n",

				"content_text": "I really love using Instagram -- use it every week to take, process &amp; share photos, use it a lot with my wife to share what we're up to, etc.\n\nBut as I was using it tonight, I realized that I'm using it in a decidedly anti-social way -- which is a really stark contrast to how I live practically every other part of my online life -- in general I live pretty much in the open on my blog, Tumblr, Twitter, etc etc.\n\nSo I thought it would be worth a quick explanation.\n\nOne of my working theories about mobile apps is that to get any real adoption, the app has to be on your home screen (and mostly not in a folder). People use apps on 2nd &amp; 3rd screens, but not that many, I think -- I think usage of apps on the home screen probably completely dominates usage of all other apps. But there are only 20 slots on the home screen, and a bunch of those are already populated by things like your e-mail, SMS, phone, calendar, Safari, etc. So there's a working set of maybe 4 or 5 slots for completely novel apps (for me the most important are Tweetbot, Facebook, Tumblr, Read It Later, Things &amp; Kindle). For all other apps, they've got to replace an app (and its functionality) that already has a spot.\n\nInstagram, for me, replaced the camera app a long time ago, initially because of filters, but over time because it let me share pictures with my family and friends really easily.\n\nBut over the summer, I realized a pretty serious problem: my follower count was rising, and I was taking more and more pictures with Instagram -- the problem was that the photos were of my family vacation, so were both pretty personal in nature, and were also like a big advertisement that our house back in the Bay Area was unattended.\n\nI still wanted the sharing &amp; filters &amp; streams, though, so ended up making my stream closed, instead of open. I uninvited everyone I didn't know and started building up the access list from scratch. Now I've got a relatively small, private set of followers, and it works well enough.\n\nBut it sort of turns the model inside out a little bit, since Instagram is really built for sharing. Instead, I'm using it more like a private repository, then sharing out pictures to other networks like Facebook, Tumblr &amp; Twitter when I want to share them broadly. But back to my apps-on-home-screen theory, the only way that Instagram can replace my Camera app is if I do it this way, making most of my photos private and only sharing a few.\n\nThe main problems are sort of obvious: (1) I share a bunch of things with fewer people than would actually like to share with, (2) it's hard for me to completely replace the built-in Camera app right now, and (3) it actually just feels pretty unfriendly when I do share something on Twitter, people click through to see the shared photo and aren't allowed to follow my stream automatically.

				"title": "My Introduction for Reid Hoffman",
				"content_html": "<p>Last night, Aneel Bhusri, Jeff Weiner and I got to introduce Reid Hoffman for an award called the Innovation Catalyst Award here in Silicon Valley. We each spent about 10 minutes talking about our experiences with Reid over the years &ndash; always a fun thing to talk about, since he&rsquo;s such an interesting, smart &amp; good-hearted person. Was interesting, too, that even thought the 3 of us hadn&rsquo;t coordinated at all in preparing our talks, they all came back to the same themes of his humanity, intelligence, and great desire to help good people be better. Reid is just a very consistent guy &ndash; he brings it every day.</p>\n<p>Best line of the night was Aneel&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Reid is kind of like the Kevin Bacon of Silicon Valley.&rdquo; Good stuff.</p>\n<p>Here are the remarks that I prepared:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<hr>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a funny task for me to introduce Reid to all of you since he&rsquo;s so well known. In fact, I&rsquo;d wager that not only does everyone here know all about Reid already, but you&rsquo;ve already had a lunch or a coffee with him at some point.</p>\n<p>I was thinking maybe it&rsquo;d be easier if I  just grabbed the 2 of you in the room that haven&rsquo;t already met him or worked with him and give you the background one-on-one. :-)</p>\n<p>His public accomplishments over the last decade are extremely well chronicled &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I need to mention the fact that he changed the world at PayPal. Or started LinkedIn, changing the way we all do work in fundamental ways. Or that he was an early angel in Flickr, Zynga, Facebook and virtually every other massively successful company that&rsquo;s come out of Silicon Valley over the last 10 years.</p>\n<p>But most of that stuff is well known by everyone here, so instead tonight I&rsquo;m going to focus on the human scale, and some of the ways that Reid has powerfully and meaningfully changed my life and the lives of so many people around him &ndash; I think that might work better to give everyone a sense of how he thinks, and why it&rsquo;s so important.</p>\n<p>The thread that will tie all of this together is that 2 questions dominate the way that Reid thinks and interacts.</p>\n<p>The first one is this: &ldquo;How can I change the world?&rdquo; But really, every good entrepreneur asks that question all the time. Reid is unusually good at answering this particular question in a variety of different ways, but if that was the only thing he focused on, he&rsquo;d be a great entrepreneur, but something less than he&rsquo;s actually become.</p>\n<p>The second question that I&rsquo;ve heard Reid ask over and over and over is very simple: &ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve heard him ask it in board meetings, in pitch meetings, at the airport, over drinks &ndash; everywhere you can imagine. And in my mind, it&rsquo;s the pervasiveness of that simple question &ndash; &ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo; &ndash; that sets Reid apart, and I&rsquo;ll expand a little on that now.</p>\n<p>My own working relationship with Reid started off innocently enough while he was still at PayPal.  I got an e-mail from an old friend Sean White who I literally hadn&rsquo;t heard from in 10 years. The mail went something like this: &ldquo;Reid, John: I think you guys might like each other; hope you can connect; I think it&rsquo;ll be worth your time.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s maybe a measure of my cluelessness at the time, or of just how incredible a decade Reid has had since, but I didn&rsquo;t know who he was, and he seemed only semi-relevant &ndash; a finance guy! from PayPal! but I trusted my friend Sean, so gave it a try.</p>\n<p>Sean was right, of course; Reid and I hit it off immediately, starting with a breakfast at Hobee&rsquo;s that would begin a strong pattern for us. He was at PayPal, I was at my own startup Reactivity then; we just got together and, predictably enough, started talking about who we knew in common. We spent a lot of time in those pre-LinkedIn days &ndash; like we still do, really, asking questions of each other like &ldquo;Have you met X? What do you think?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;do you know about company Y? Important?&rdquo; And: &ldquo;Who else do you think I should get to know?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s Reid, always, always, always building networks, always trying to put people together, see if they might fit.</p>\n<p>Over time we started working on various projects together, including Mozilla, and we&rsquo;d each have lists of things to talk about going into each breakfast. The really remarkable thing about these interactions is that no matter how long we talked, no matter how much of our lists we would work through, we invariably left the meal with longer lists than we entered with &ndash; with more things to talk about, covering more shared areas of interst. And really it&rsquo;s gone on like that since &ndash; another Reid characteristic for you: he&rsquo;s always looking for more ways to help.</p>\n<p>The other thing that was obvious about Reid at that point is that he always had a plan, and he pretty much did what he said he was going to do. He was really clear when the PayPal acquisition happened that he would be on to his next thing, whatever it was, soon. I figured he would take a bit of time off, catch his breath. I didn&rsquo;t know Reid well enough then, obviously &ndash; he quickly moved on, figured out that helping other people build work networks was what he wanted his attention to be on. So he got started.</p>\n<p>The conversation around LinkedIn was funny &ndash; obviously LinkedIn was the ideal startup for someone who thinks in terms of people networks like Reid does &ndash; in a lot of ways it&rsquo;s the exact manifestation of his brain.</p>\n<p>I was a little skeptical at the time &ndash; I told him, well, this might be good for &ldquo;B listers with B list networks.&rdquo; Obviously, folks with A list networks like mine wouldn&rsquo;t want to participate. Reid gleefully reminds me of that interaction at the most inopportune times. They seem to be doing well enough so far. :-)</p>\n<p>But he was off to the races with LinkedIn, and around the same time I was trying to figure out what to do myself, having left my own startup a few months previously. And like he&rsquo;s helped so many others figure out their path, he was extrordinarily helpful with figuring out mine. In 2005 I had sort of stumbled onto an unusual organization &ndash; a non-profit, and open source project &ndash; called Mozilla &ndash; it was just15 or so employees, but they had just released Firefox a few months before, and it held great promise &ndash; it was really starting to catch on. Reid &amp; I both saw the promise right away, but as I thought about joining it, I was on the fence.</p>\n<p>Typically, he thought we should discuss it more with someone he knew &ndash; in this case Joi Ito, now Director of MIT&rsquo;s Media Lab. He said &ldquo;Joi&rsquo;s going to be in town for about 90 minutes, so we need to meet him at SFO.&rdquo; I made fun of him a lot for having airport meetings &ndash; now of course, the joke is on me, since I schedule them, too.</p>\n<p>So we met at SFO and had a conversation that, again, was typical of Reid &amp; Joi, and went something like this: &ldquo;do you think Mozilla is a place from which we can change the world a bunch for the better?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seems like it.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Well, seems like we should all lean in then!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s another very Reid phrase: &ldquo;lean in&rdquo; &ndash; it means we should figure out how to do something meaningful.</p>\n<p>Reid likes to think about Archimedian levers &ndash; how to change the world the most with the most efficiency &ndash; and when he finds good spots to put the lever, he&rsquo;s generally all in.</p>\n<p>So from that meeting, we each leaned in &ndash; Joi would eventually join the Foundation&rsquo;s board of directors, Reid would join the Corporation&rsquo;s board of directors, and I joined in an operating capacity.</p>\n<p>So for me, and for Mozilla, Reid&rsquo;s orientation around finding ways to change the world, and to help others do the same, whether as entrepreneurs or social entrepreneurs or any other way &ndash; well, his point of view changed everything for us.</p>\n<p>And then I got to know Reid over the next several years as a board member, which is another great privilege, although a bit of a quirky one. Reid has a tendency to be extra outfitted in terms of his information technology. He&rsquo;ll typically carry around 2 laptops and somewhere between 3 and 5 smart phones. So when he would come for a board meeting, lots of times he would bring out various of his devices and work away &ndash; enough so that you might start to think he wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. But he is. Invariably during our board meetings, we&rsquo;d be cruising along, Reid would be typing something or other then he&rsquo;d pause, look up, and say something like &ldquo;Really? That doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Wouldn&rsquo;t it really be more like this other way?&rdquo; He had a funny way of completely changing the flow of the meeting, of causing us to re-focus on the most strategic items again and again &ndash; as usual with Reid, it was him searching for the best leverage possible.</p>\n<p>The funniest things were always when you talked about recruiting in a board meeting, though &ndash; every time I got back to my desk after discussing an open position at Mozilla, I&rsquo;d have between 10 and 20 LinkedIn profiles waiting in my e-mail, suggestions from Reid on who to talk with next. His output is amazing that way. Even when dealing with a million other competing priorities, he&rsquo;s as productive as anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>\n<p>I talk about these very personal experiences because they&rsquo;re the ones that I know the best, but, really, you could ask just about any current entrepreneur in Silicon Valley how Reid&rsquo;s helped &ndash; he&rsquo;s always got suggestions, connections, questions, tweaks to your thinking.</p>\n<p>Everyone&rsquo;s got a &ldquo;Reid story&rdquo;, everyone knows his aphorism &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not embarrassed by your first product you&rsquo;ve released too late!&rdquo; (Although now that I&rsquo;m an investor myself, I probably could stand hearing that from a few less startups who actually did release too early!)</p>\n<p>Here are a few insights from folks who know Reid well:</p>\n<p>Nancy Lublin, CEO of DoSomething.org (where Reid&rsquo;s a board member), said this: &ldquo;In a world where engineers have been the biggest winners over the last ten years, how did a philosopher become top shelf? It&rsquo;s kind of an awesome winning forumla: the guy loves people. It&rsquo;s not a mush, emotional thing. He&rsquo;s actually extraordinarily logical &ndash; and to him, figuring out how people can become better is like solving a puzzle.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Or DJ Patil, Greylock&rsquo;s Data Scientist in Residence, who previously built the LinkedIn data team tells the story about how he went to introduce himself to Reid in a parking lot at UC Santa Cruz, whereupon Reid responded &ldquo;Yes, I know who you are, we need to have lunch.&rdquo; Their first lunch after that was 3 hours long.</p>\n<p>And my own most recent example &ndash; I saw a pretty early, pretty raw startup this summer for a first meeting, which went well enough. I gave them some candid feedback and made some suggestions on how they might improve their product, at the end of which they said, &ldquo;Okay, got it. But what do you think Reid Hoffman would think of our pitch?&rdquo; Hilarious. :-)</p>\n<p>Overall though, here&rsquo;s the thing: I haven&rsquo;t met a single person in more than 20 years in Silicon Valley who&rsquo;s more generous with their contacts or time, who&rsquo;s more willing to listen and learn and brainstorm, or who genuinely wants everyone he meets to become as good an entrepreneur (in their work and in their own lives) as they can possibly be.</p>\n<p>His fingerprints are all over today&rsquo;s business and technology landscape, and increasingly our social landscape.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s got some of the flashiest credentials of anyone in the industry, but it&rsquo;s hard for me to think of a more honest, self-effacing person to meet with.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s busier than anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met, but he will always make time to meet with young entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s smarter and more knowledgable about how the consumer Internet works than just about anyone, but leaves every meeting thinking about what he&rsquo;s learned that&rsquo;s new, where his old models don&rsquo;t fit.</p>\n<p>And the guy barely has time to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a book, let alone write one, but that&rsquo;s exactly what he&rsquo;s done this year. The focus? Helping everyone become an entrepreneur in their own life, naturally.</p>\n<p>So in a lot of ways he&rsquo;s a bundle of competing priorities and tensions.</p>\n<p>But in the ways that matter, he&rsquo;s a pretty simple guy, always asking &ldquo;How can we change the world?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How can we help?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As Nancy Lublin puts it, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the best example I know of good guys finishing first,&rdquo; and so I&rsquo;m very humbled to be introducing my partner and my friend Reid Hoffman tonight.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "Last night, Aneel Bhusri, Jeff Weiner and I got to introduce Reid Hoffman for an award called the Innovation Catalyst Award here in Silicon Valley. We each spent about 10 minutes talking about our experiences with Reid over the years -- always a fun thing to talk about, since he's such an interesting, smart &amp; good-hearted person. Was interesting, too, that even thought the 3 of us hadn't coordinated at all in preparing our talks, they all came back to the same themes of his humanity, intelligence, and great desire to help good people be better. Reid is just a very consistent guy -- he brings it every day.\n\nBest line of the night was Aneel's: \"Reid is kind of like the Kevin Bacon of Silicon Valley.\" Good stuff.\n\nHere are the remarks that I prepared:<em></em>\n\n-----\n\nIt's a funny task for me to introduce Reid to all of you since he's so well known. In fact, I'd wager that not only does everyone here know all about Reid already, but you've already had a lunch or a coffee with him at some point.\n\nI was thinking maybe it'd be easier if I  just grabbed the 2 of you in the room that haven't already met him or worked with him and give you the background one-on-one. :-)\n\nHis public accomplishments over the last decade are extremely well chronicled -- I don't think I need to mention the fact that he changed the world at PayPal. Or started LinkedIn, changing the way we all do work in fundamental ways. Or that he was an early angel in Flickr, Zynga, Facebook and virtually every other massively successful company that's come out of Silicon Valley over the last 10 years.\n\nBut most of that stuff is well known by everyone here, so instead tonight I'm going to focus on the human scale, and some of the ways that Reid has powerfully and meaningfully changed my life and the lives of so many people around him -- I think that might work better to give everyone a sense of how he thinks, and why it's so important.\n\nThe thread that will tie all of this together is that 2 questions dominate the way that Reid thinks and interacts.\n\nThe first one is this: \"How can I change the world?\" But really, every good entrepreneur asks that question all the time. Reid is unusually good at answering this particular question in a variety of different ways, but if that was the only thing he focused on, he'd be a great entrepreneur, but something less than he's actually become.\n\nThe second question that I've heard Reid ask over and over and over is very simple: \"How can I help?\"\n\nI've heard him ask it in board meetings, in pitch meetings, at the airport, over drinks -- everywhere you can imagine. And in my mind, it's the pervasiveness of that simple question -- \"How can I help?\" -- that sets Reid apart, and I'll expand a little on that now.\n\nMy own working relationship with Reid started off innocently enough while he was still at PayPal.  I got an e-mail from an old friend Sean White who I literally hadn't heard from in 10 years.

				"title": "Steve Jobs",
				"content_html": "<p>Like many of us, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about Steve Jobs the last few days &ndash; thinking about the man and his legacy. I&rsquo;ve been having some trouble even understanding the way I feel, let alone being able to put it into words. Lots of folks have asked me what I think, and have been surprised that I haven&rsquo;t tweeted or blogged about it yet. So here&rsquo;s a first shot.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m finding my feelings to be pretty complex, which I guess isn&rsquo;t too surprising given who he was. But for a man I&rsquo;ve never met, I&rsquo;m a little surprised about how much of my thinking he&rsquo;s affected, and how many competing feelings I&rsquo;ve got.</p>\n<p>But some of them are pretty simple.</p>\n<p>As a designer, I think it&rsquo;s impossible to feel anything but pure, unadulterated joy that Steve existed at all. And I really mean that: thank god for him, he changed so much. He wasn&rsquo;t the first to care about design in technology, and he won&rsquo;t be the last, but he moved things so much.</p>\n<p>He made beautiful software and hardware like nobody had ever seen before. Crucially, he built tools that helped &ndash; or completely enabled, really &ndash; creatives make their own beautiful work that enriched the world. He completely and utterly validated the view that design could be immensely valuable economically, not just culturally.</p>\n<p>Mostly he made it acceptable &ndash; desirable! &ndash; to believe in and practice great, human-centered design in our work and lives. What a gift.</p>\n<p>As a people manager and leader, I really struggled with how to think about him. The stories of how brutal he could be on the people around him &ndash; employees, competitors, and everyone else &ndash; are legion, and they&rsquo;re not apocryphal. He could be deeply dehumanizing and belittling to the people around him. Like a lot of people of great vision, which he surely was, he did it all in the name of greatness, of perfection &ndash; but I have enough close friends who have been in the line of Jobs' fire to know how personally destructive it could be, and as a manager I have a hard time with it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, he was an unbelievable leader and motivator.</p>\n<p>It turns out that I worked at Apple ATG (Advanced Technology Group) in 1994/5 when I was a grad student at Stanford, and then again for all of 1997, when I moved back here from Trilogy.</p>\n<p>I remember being at a talk he gave shortly after returning in 1997 as Interim CEO. A bunch of us employees (I was at ATG at the time) were in Town Hall in Building 4 at Infinite Loop to hear him, and he was fired up. Talked a lot about how Apple was going to completely turn things around and become great.</p>\n<p>It was a tough time at Apple &ndash; we were trading below book value on the market &ndash; our enterprise value was actually less than our cash on hand. And the rumors were everywhere that we were going to be acquired by Sun. Someone in the audience asked him about Michael Dell&rsquo;s suggestion in the press a few days previous that Apple should just shut down and return the cash to shareholders, and as I recall, Steve&rsquo;s response was: &ldquo;Fuck Michael Dell.&rdquo; Good god, what a message from a CEO! He followed it up by admitting that the stock price was terrible (it was under $10, I think &ndash; pretty sure it was under $2 split-adjusted), and that what they were going to do was reissue everyone&rsquo;s options on the low price, but with a new 3 year vest. He said, explicitly: &ldquo;If you want to make Apple great again, let&rsquo;s get going. If not, get the hell out.&rdquo; I think it&rsquo;s not an overstatement to say that just about everyone in the room loved him at that point, would have followed him off a cliff if that&rsquo;s where he led.</p>\n<p>He was also a gifted, gifted operator. One of the struggles we were going through when he came back was that Apple was about the leakiest organization in history &ndash; it had gotten so bad that people were cavalier about it.

				"content_text": "Like many of us, I've been thinking a lot about Steve Jobs the last few days -- thinking about the man and his legacy. I've been having some trouble even understanding the way I feel, let alone being able to put it into words. Lots of folks have asked me what I think, and have been surprised that I haven't tweeted or blogged about it yet. So here's a first shot.\n\nI'm finding my feelings to be pretty complex, which I guess isn't too surprising given who he was. But for a man I've never met, I'm a little surprised about how much of my thinking he's affected, and how many competing feelings I've got.\n\nBut some of them are pretty simple.\n\nAs a designer, I think it's impossible to feel anything but pure, unadulterated joy that Steve existed at all. And I really mean that: thank god for him, he changed so much. He wasn't the first to care about design in technology, and he won't be the last, but he moved things so much.\n\nHe made beautiful software and hardware like nobody had ever seen before. Crucially, he built tools that helped -- or completely enabled, really -- creatives make their own beautiful work that enriched the world. He completely and utterly validated the view that design could be immensely valuable economically, not just culturally.\n\nMostly he made it acceptable -- desirable! -- to believe in and practice great, human-centered design in our work and lives. What a gift.\n\nAs a people manager and leader, I really struggled with how to think about him. The stories of how brutal he could be on the people around him -- employees, competitors, and everyone else -- are legion, and they're not apocryphal. He could be deeply dehumanizing and belittling to the people around him. Like a lot of people of great vision, which he surely was, he did it all in the name of greatness, of perfection -- but I have enough close friends who have been in the line of Jobs' fire to know how personally destructive it could be, and as a manager I have a hard time with it.\n\nOn the other hand, he was an unbelievable leader and motivator.\n\nIt turns out that I worked at Apple ATG (Advanced Technology Group) in 1994/5 when I was a grad student at Stanford, and then again for all of 1997, when I moved back here from Trilogy.\n\nI remember being at a talk he gave shortly after returning in 1997 as Interim CEO. A bunch of us employees (I was at ATG at the time) were in Town Hall in Building 4 at Infinite Loop to hear him, and he was fired up. Talked a lot about how Apple was going to completely turn things around and become great.\n\nIt was a tough time at Apple -- we were trading below book value on the market -- our enterprise value was actually less than our cash on hand. And the rumors were everywhere that we were going to be acquired by Sun. Someone in the audience asked him about Michael Dell's suggestion in the press a few days previous that Apple should just shut down and return the cash to shareholders, and as I recall, Steve's response was: \"Fuck Michael Dell.\" Good god, what a message from a CEO! He followed it up by admitting that the stock price was terrible (it was under $10, I think -- pretty sure it was under $2 split-adjusted), and that what they were going to do was reissue everyone's options on the low price, but with a new 3 year vest. He said, explicitly: \"If you want to make Apple great again, let's get going. If not, get the hell out.\" I think it's not an overstatement to say that just about everyone in the room loved him at that point, would have followed him off a cliff if that's where he led.\n\nHe was also a gifted, gifted operator. One of the struggles we were going through when he came back was that Apple was about the leakiest organization in history -- it had gotten so bad that people were cavalier about it. In the face of all those leaks, I remember the first all company e-mail that Steve sent around after becoming Interim CEO again -- he talked in it about how Apple would release a few things in the coming week, and a desire to tighten up communications so that employees would know more about what was going on -- and how that required more respect for confidentiality. That mail was sent on a Thursday; I remember all of us getting to work on Monday morning and reading mail from Fred Anderson, our then-CFO, who said basically: \"Steve sent mail last week, he told you not to leak, we were tracking everyone's mail, and 4 people sent the details to outsiders. They've all been terminated and are no longer with the company.\"\n\nWell. If it wasn't clear before that the Amelio/Spindler/Sculley days of Apple were over, it was crystal clear then, and good riddance.\n\nAs a leader of people, you have to respect how much he (and more importantly, his teams) accomplished. But I struggle with some of the ways that he led, and how they affected good people.\n\nStill.\n\nI'm a little uncomfortable with the outpouring of sentiment about people who want to be like Steve. There's a sort of beatification going on that I think misses the point. He was never a nostalgic man at all, and I can't help but feel like he would think this posthumous attention was, in a lot of ways, a waste -- seems like he'd have wanted people to get back to inventing.\n\nOn Twitter yesterday <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/naval\">Naval</a> nailed it, as he often does: \"I never met my greatest mentor. I wanted so much to be like him. But, his message was the opposite. Be yourself, with passionate intensity.\"\n\nThat's it, I think -- that's the biggest message from Jobs' life. Don't try to be like Steve. Don't try to be like anyone.\n\nBe yourself and work as hard as you can to bring wonderful things into the world. Figure out how you want to contribute and do that, in your own way, on your own terms, as hard as you can, as much as you can, as long as you can.\n\nHis most lasting message, I hope, won't be about technology or management or media or communications or even design.

I&rsquo;ve given talks over the years for his classes, but for this one we decided to mix things up, and so he &amp; I just had a conversation. He had a few questions prepared, but, honestly, we have so many shared interests in how to manage people and organizations that it took a first starter question for us to riff on a bit &ndash; and that generated plenty of questions from the class for the rest of the hour.</p>\n<p>2 questions stood out to me that I thought were worth writing about some.</p>\n<p>The first was this: how do you motivate people? I had to think about this for a bit, because my answer is sort of a cheat: it seems to me that it&rsquo;s too hard to motivate people who aren&rsquo;t. So what you need to do is to hire incredibly motivated people, take them off the leash, and help them be great. Now, I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hiring great people is definitely hard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; but finding motivated people isn&rsquo;t really as hard as it sounds.

				"content_text": "Earlier this week I got to spend some time with one of my favorite professors and thinkers, B<a href=\"http://bobsutton.typepad.com\">ob Sutton</a>, in one of his classes at Stanford. I've given talks over the years for his classes, but for this one we decided to mix things up, and so he &amp; I just had a conversation. He had a few questions prepared, but, honestly, we have so many shared interests in how to manage people and organizations that it took a first starter question for us to riff on a bit -- and that generated plenty of questions from the class for the rest of the hour.\n\n2 questions stood out to me that I thought were worth writing about some.\n\nThe first was this: how do you motivate people? I had to think about this for a bit, because my answer is sort of a cheat: it seems to me that it's too hard to motivate people who aren't. So what you need to do is to hire incredibly motivated people, take them off the leash, and help them be great. Now, I think <a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2011/05/20/recruiting-dna/\">hiring great people is definitely hard</a> -- but finding motivated people isn't really as hard as it sounds. My strong, strong belief is that <em>most people really, really want to be good at what they want to do. </em>In life, in work, in sport, whatever. People want to be good. Mostly people are willing to put in work to become good. So in my experience the art of getting motivated output is just helping people understand<em> what good is</em> and how to get from here to there. If you show them and help them get there, the motivation usually takes care of itself.\n\nThe other interesting question is something like: why do people think you're a good leader? This one I had to think through some -- because I think there are a lot of details that maybe aren't the core reason. But I think the core, long lasting reason is that most people I've worked with over the last 20 years or so know that I really want to help them win, to help them be good themselves.

				"content_text": "<p>I haven't written much yet about my experiences during my first year on the VC side of the table -- I've been pretty busy just learning, doing, trying to process everything as I go.</p>\n<p>Along the way I've met a LOT of new people -- entrepreneurs, investors, designers, scientists, on and on. I've always had a pretty large network of friends and colleagues, but this year it's pretty well exploded -- I've gotten to spend some time with amazing, amazing people I hadn't really spent time with before.</p>\n<p>But the interesting, and maybe counter-intuitive thing I'm finding is this: as I'm meeting so many more capable and awesome people, my core group of collaborators -- the folks who I've built companies and careers together with over the last 20 years -- while I see the core group less often, I'm finding that the interactions I have with them to be much more valuable.</p>\n<p>One of the best pieces of advice I ever got, back when I was 23 and newly out of school, is this: look around and figure out who you want to be on your team. Figure out the people around you that you want to work with for the rest of your life. Figure out the people who are smart &amp; awesome, who share your values, who get things done -- and maybe most important, who you like to be with and who you want to help win. And treat them right, always. Look for ways to help, to work together, to learn. Because in 20 years you'll all be in amazing places doing amazing things.</p>\n<p>That's turned out to be true for me. Knowing who's on your team -- or as Reid likes to say, who's in your \"tribe\" -- has been critically important for me, even though I don't see them all as much as I'd like.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It&rsquo;s been a busy summer for us, one full of change, and I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this post for a while, but just haven&rsquo;t had the time to sit down until today. WARNING! it&rsquo;s a bit saccharine on the topic of being a parent. Beware. :-)</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s about the bittersweetness and ephemeral nature of being a parent &ndash; the overwhelming feeling that I&rsquo;ve had ever since SPL was born is happiness mixed with an acute awareness of how quickly time moves, how quickly SPL is changing and growing and developing.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the essential nature of being a parent is building and creating, and then always letting go. Letting go of the kid that lived in your house yesterday, accepting that they&rsquo;ve changed and are becoming the person they&rsquo;ll be tomorrow. It&rsquo;s been hard for me to explain to people without kids; it&rsquo;s been universally &amp; immediately understood by my friends with kids.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about it here in the context of our trip to Disneyland this summer.</p>\n<p>Now, it&rsquo;s easy to be cynical about The Walt Disney Company and the various parks and properties that they run &ndash; and I&rsquo;m often cynical myself about them. But I have to say that I really love going to Disney World and Disneyland &ndash; I always have &ndash; and I really, really love going with Kathy &amp; SPL. I love being there, I love exploring with them, and none of the machinery of manipulation of the place really bothers me all that much.</p>\n<p>This year, with SPL being 6, was a fun mix of wanting to venture out on his own and wanting to hug tight to Kathy and me. It felt like we&rsquo;re crossing a line towards more and more independence.</p>\n<p>So here&rsquo;s a story in 4 pictures.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Above and beyond everything else, the trip is a time that the three of us get concentrated, dedicated time with not much to worry about other than just being a family.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One of the best parts about an experience like this is the combination of familiar and completely new things to experience together. Above is a picture of SPL &amp; me watching one of the parades, talking about what we saw together, processing it together.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>At just 6 years old, SPL still gets excited by the characters, loves hugs and holding close. We didn&rsquo;t get too many pictures of it, but lots of times SPL grabbed onto Kathy and me &ndash; he&rsquo;s still small enough that he wants the safety of his parents, and isn&rsquo;t really 100% ready to take on the experiences by himself.</p>\n<p>Still, my favorite picture of the trip this year is this one:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It&rsquo;s on one of the smaller roller coasters in the park &ndash; in Toon Town, and this was the very first time he was able to ride the coaster by himself (I was in the seat behind, obviously).</p>\n<p>I just love this picture because it represents so much about the way SPL is beginning to engage with the world now &ndash; in an &ldquo;arms up, even though it&rsquo;s a little scary for me&rdquo; mode.</p>\n<p>And as hard as it is when on the 2nd day of kindergarten he shoos you out of the room or runs away from you across the playground &ndash; and it is hard, and emotional &ndash; again, tough to describe to anyone without kids.</p>\n<p>As hard as that feeling is to experience, it&rsquo;s also exactly, exactly the thing you want for your child. An eagerness to engage with the new, to run unafraid towards the unknown.</p>\n<p>So for me, that&rsquo;s the essential quality of being a parent. Spending endless hours building and caring, and then just letting go and watching. The wisest thing anyone&rsquo;s said to me since SPL was born is this: &ldquo;The days are long, but the years are short.&rdquo; That seems awfully right to me, and sort of wonderful, too.</p>\n",

Beware. :-)\n\nIt's about the bittersweetness and ephemeral nature of being a parent -- the overwhelming feeling that I've had ever since SPL was born is happiness mixed with an acute awareness of how quickly time moves, how quickly SPL is changing and growing and developing.\n\nIt seems to me that the essential nature of being a parent is building and creating, and then always letting go. Letting go of the kid that lived in your house yesterday, accepting that they've changed and are becoming the person they'll be tomorrow. It's been hard for me to explain to people without kids; it's been universally &amp; immediately understood by my friends with kids.\n\nI'll talk about it here in the context of our trip to Disneyland this summer.\n\nNow, it's easy to be cynical about The Walt Disney Company and the various parks and properties that they run -- and I'm often cynical myself about them. But I have to say that I really love going to Disney World and Disneyland -- I always have -- and I really, really love going with Kathy &amp; SPL. I love being there, I love exploring with them, and none of the machinery of manipulation of the place really bothers me all that much.\n\nThis year, with SPL being 6, was a fun mix of wanting to venture out on his own and wanting to hug tight to Kathy and me. It felt like we're crossing a line towards more and more independence.\n\nSo here's a story in 4 pictures.\n\n<img src=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/family.jpg\" alt=\"family.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\">\n\nAbove and beyond everything else, the trip is a time that the three of us get concentrated, dedicated time with not much to worry about other than just being a family.\n\n<img src=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/watching.jpg\" alt=\"watching.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\">\n\nOne of the best parts about an experience like this is the combination of familiar and completely new things to experience together. Above is a picture of SPL &amp; me watching one of the parades, talking about what we saw together, processing it together.\n\n<img src=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pooh.jpg\" alt=\"pooh.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\">\n\nAt just 6 years old, SPL still gets excited by the characters, loves hugs and holding close. We didn't get too many pictures of it, but lots of times SPL grabbed onto Kathy and me -- he's still small enough that he wants the safety of his parents, and isn't really 100% ready to take on the experiences by himself.\n\nStill, my favorite picture of the trip this year is this one:\n\n<img style=\"border:1px #000000 solid;\" src=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/free.jpg\" alt=\"free.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\">\n\nIt's on one of the smaller roller coasters in the park -- in Toon Town, and this was the very first time he was able to ride the coaster by himself (I was in the seat behind, obviously).\n\nI just love this picture because it represents so much about the way SPL is beginning to engage with the world now -- in an \"arms up, even though it's a little scary for me\" mode.\n\nAnd as hard as it is when on the 2nd day of kindergarten he shoos you out of the room or runs away from you across the playground -- and it is hard, and emotional -- again, tough to describe to anyone without kids.\n\nAs hard as that feeling is to experience, it's also exactly, exactly the thing you want for your child. An eagerness to engage with the new, to run unafraid towards the unknown.\n\nSo for me, that's the essential quality of being a parent. Spending endless hours building and caring, and then just letting go and watching. The wisest thing anyone's said to me since SPL was born is this: \"The days are long, but the years are short.\" That seems awfully right to me, and sort of wonderful, too.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've been thinking a bunch about platforms lately, and how they're evolving very very quickly. Generally, there are two categories of thing that people talk about as platforms. Traditionally, they've been computer operating systems: Windows, OS X &amp; Linux, now iOS &amp; Android. Lately people are talking about cloud platforms: services like EC2, but also web services with APIs that other apps are built to integrate with.</p>\n<p>But more and more, that's not the way I'm thinking about my own systems; as devices proliferate at my own home, and as I tend to use tiny connected computers in more numerous and varied contexts.</p>\n<p>I've been interested in what I call \"4 screen &amp; a cloud\" products for a while: products that help us unify and take advantage of our laptop + phone + tablet + tv -- but it all became a little clearer to me a few weeks when a wave of devices entered the house all at the same time. In the space of a few weeks, I upgraded to an iPad2, got a Samsung Tab to experiment with Android Tablets, got an Android phone in addition to my iPhone, and got a WebOS phone from the D9 conference. So we had all those devices in the house, plus our iMac, Kathy's set of devices, and my mom's as well, since she was visiting. Oh, and 3 Kindles between the three of us. Screens were everywhere.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm the first to recognize that we're somewhat atypical in our technology consumption in normal times; add to that the devices that I've picked up lately because of work and my house is a jumble of operating systems, devices and power adapters. Exciting!</p>\n<p>When you get that many screens and devices, what happens is interesting: when you want to do something, communicate with someone, remember something, schedule an appointment, read a book, or whatever, you just pick up whatever screen is nearest to you and work from that.</p>\n<p>Well, you do that if you can. Because in our current platform chaos, not all devices are fungible, not all activities are available from all platforms.</p>\n<p>So that got me thinking some about what I need, and where, and in what contexts and on what devices, and now I think about platforms this way: I have a set of screens, a set of stuff, and a set of people that I want to do things with -- and I want those sets available to me wherever &amp; whenever I am.</p>\n<p>By <strong>screens</strong>, I mean something more than just pixels: I really mean input &amp; output systems, of which screens are the most visible parts; really it should probably be screens, sensors &amp; speakers. In other words, it's the displays of each system, the audio systems, and the ways that we indicate intent, be it typing, swiping, speaking, remote-button-puching, <a href=\"http://affect.media.mit.edu/\">smiling</a>, <a href=\"http://www.xbox.com/kinect\">waving</a>, <a href=\"http://www.runkeeper.com\">running</a>, or <a href=\"http://myzeo.com\">just being</a>.</p>\n<p>By <strong>storage</strong>, I mean something more than just bits: while Dropbox and iCloud and Clouddrive are important, I want to do more than just store and share my files with others. It's about more than having a place to put my music. It's about having the context of my life: my apps, my reading material, my history of shopping &amp; interest intent. It's really the things I'm creating, consuming, sharing, saving, working on and just thinking about. One of the things that's probably non-obvious about this formulation is that for this to work, the storage is going to be pretty keyed to my identity. Without knowing something about who I am, it won't work.</p>\n<p>And by <strong>network</strong>, I mean something more than just my Facebook graph: what's becoming clear is that we've all got many and diverse groupings in our lives, ranging from the very intimate groups of a nuclear family to the wide-ranging groupings of Twitter followers. The short version, though, is that it's becoming increasingly clear that, just like in the offline world, people online want to do things with each other. Shocking, I know.</p>\n<p>That's the definition of platform that's relevant to me: a combination of screens, storage and networks that help me do my work and live my life. The companies that see that true platforms transcend any one particular technology stack will be the ones that prosper -- you can already see some interesting ones emerge.</p>\n<p>As a side note, I think screens, storage &amp; networks is one way to look at the landscape of the giants competing: it's where Apple, Google, Facebook &amp; Amazon are slugging it out (and to some extent it's the evolution now of my old stomping ground, Mozilla). I would argue that each of the giants has a super strong position in 1 or 2 of the three areas, but none has a lock on all three, and most of the interesting initiatives of each are about strengthening the places where they're historically weak.</p>\n<p>Apple is obviously terrific at screens, okay at storage, and not very good at networks.</p>\n<p>Google's now strong at screens (although probably not as strong as Apple) and could be great at storage, and finally has a credible start on networks.</p>\n<p>Facebook is incredibly strong at networks, has some weakness in screens, and is pretty good with storage (at least for things like photos).</p>\n<p>And Amazon is very strong on storage, weak at networks, and weak (at the moment) on screens.</p>\n<p>I'd argue that their relative strengths and weaknesses are  important for startups to understand as well, as that gives you a bit of a map of one set of opportunities.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's how I'm thinking about things lately. What do you think?</p>\n",

Anyway, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to say.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Adventures of the Mind 2011 Talk</p>\n<p>A couple of years ago when I gave a talk for Adventures of the Mind 2009 in Princeton, I talked about how important the people around you are to success. Because you never know what the big decision points in your life are, it&rsquo;s really hard to intentionally design your life. But you CAN design who you spend time with, and being around amazing people &ndash; always trying to put yourself into rooms with people who are smarter than you, even if it makes you feel bad &ndash; that that strategy will tend to mean that great opportunities will find you.</p>\n<p>So that was a &ldquo;HOW&rdquo; talk. How to make sure to be around great choices in your life.</p>\n<p>Today I want to give more of a WHAT &amp; WHY talk.  I always like starting with the punchline, so here&rsquo;s the punchline for my talk: everyone in this room is amazing potential. But we need to move potential into action, into change, into improvement. Everyone in this room needs to think about how you want the world to be, AND THEN YOU NEED TO GO MAKE THE WORLD YOU WANT.</p>\n<p>Make the world you want to live in. That&rsquo;s the only way you get it.</p>\n<p>But let me start by giving you a little background about me. When I was graduating high school 20 years ago and getting ready to go to Stanford, I figured I would be a physicist. That was the plan until about the 3rd problem set of my Stanford career, which was approximately the hardest thing I&rsquo;d ever seen. It was immediately obvious to me that I could never be world class as a physicist, so I went looking for things I could be world class at. And my next stop for several years was computer science and user interface design, which I was pretty good at. But again, as I got out into the working world, it became clear again that while I could be really good at interaction design, there was no way I could be one of the best in the world at it. So, again, I went looking for what I was good at, and what I found was that I was really good at thinking about how to organize people, how to lead them, how to manage them. That I felt I could be world class at, and that&rsquo;s been what I&rsquo;ve done, working at startups in Silicon Valley for the 20 years since then.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve meandered around doing interesting things with awesome people since then, but am best known at this point for the job before the one that I have now, as the CEO of Mozilla, who makes Firefox.</p>\n<p>So how many of you have used Firefox?</p>\n<p>And how many of you knew that it&rsquo;s made be a tiny 300 person company that&rsquo;s a non-profit?</p>\n<p>I want to show you a short video about Mozilla, Firefox, and what a unique organization it is.</p>\n<p>(video)</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done over the last 5 or 6 years, and it&rsquo;s been amazing. Just trying to make the web better, getting to about 450 million users in the world, breaking the Microsoft monopoly on browsers and operating systems. Making the world a little more like we wanted it.</p>\n<p>It was sort of an accident that I ended up at Mozilla though &ndash; let me tell you that story: after my own startup, I was trying to find my next thing &ndash; I actually wanted to be a venture capitalist, which is what I am now, but in 2005 I couldn&rsquo;t find the right place for me. I ran into Mitchell Baker, who ran the Mozilla project, then about 15 employees total, and told her I really liked what they were doing, and that I&rsquo;d like to help. She said great! So we had this awesome brainstorming session, felt like we could make things better, I went home and wrote up this really long e-mail about what I thought she should do. And she never responded to me. This happened a couple of times, and I eventually said, &ldquo;Shit. If I want to help, I probably need to go actually work there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But still I was on the fence.</p>\n<p>Then something lucky happened: Mitchell invited me to go to a meeting with her and the other leaders at Yahoo (this was back when Yahoo was still marginally cool), where we would meet with Jerry Yang. So I tagged along, excited to meet Jerry. Well, he showed up 45 minutes late for an hour long meeting, and he started yelling at us right away. Long story about exactly why he yelled at us, but roughly it&rsquo;s because people were adopting Firefox so quickly that it was causing Yahoo real market share problems.

Lots of good experiment-based reflection on how we interact with objects, and I think significantly deeper and more nuanced than, say, Cliff Nass' work a decade or so that he wrote about in <i>The Media Equation.</i> (Admittedly, we're a lot further down the road now than when Nass wrote that, but even when it had just come out, I found it to be an extremely superficial analysis.)</p>\n<p>The second half of the book is what I really wanted to get into: how are we changing the way we relate to other actual human beings as we moderate more and more interactions through electronic media. In lay terms: how are digital social networks affecting the way we communicate, experience, and live our lives, both with those who are physically with us and those who aren't.</p>\n<p>I thought Turkle did a good job with a bunch of this topic, with one proviso: the technology and products we use are now evolving so quickly that it seems to me that any clinical, experimental understanding of what's going on is going to necessarily be years out of date, even for highly motivated, diligent, and speedy researchers.</p>\n<p>I think there weren't a ton of clear conclusions in the book, but much that we should all think about more deeply, so I'll leave you with a few of Professor Turkle's passages. If you care about understanding what's changing and why in our communications and interpersonal interactions, you should read this book. A few quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we can feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed—and only for the parts we find useful, comforting, or amusing.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><span class=\"highlight\"><span class=\"highlight\">\"The media has tended to portray today’s young adults as a generation that no longer cares about privacy. I have found something else, something equally disquieting. High school and college students don’t really understand the rules. Are they being watched? Who is watching? Do you have to do something to provoke surveillance, or is it routine? Is surveillance legal? They don’t really understand the terms of</span> for Facebook or Gmail, the mail service that Google provides. They don’t know what protections they are “entitled” to. They don’t know what objections are reasonable or possible. If someone impersonates you by getting access to your cell phone, should that behavior be treated as illegal or as a prank? In teenagers’ experience, their elders—the generation that gave them this technology—don’t have ready answers to such questions.\"<br></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><span class=\"highlight\"><span class=\"highlight\">\"The networked culture is very young. Attendants at its birth, we threw ourselves into its adventure. This is human. But these days, our problems with the Net are becoming too distracting to ignore. At the extreme, we are so enmeshed in our connections that we neglect each other. We don’t need to reject or disparage technology. We need to put it in its place. The generation that has grown up with the Net is in a good position to do this, but these young people need help. So as they begin to fight for their right to privacy, we must be their partners. We know how easily information can be politically</span> abused; we have the perspective of history. We have, perhaps, not shared enough about that history with our children. And as we, ourselves enchanted, turned away from them to lose ourselves in our e-mail, we did not sufficiently teach the importance of empathy and attention to what is real.\"<br></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Great stuff. Read it. :-)</p>\n",

I really like reading about all periods of the civilization, and have been learning more and more since I first took Latin in high school. It's esoteric to a lot of people, but it's something that's always been fascinating to me. And I like both the \"great man\" aspect of histories which follow the named leaders, but also the accounts of what it was like to live in Rome itself, or in the provinces elsewhere.</p>\n<p>But to be honest, I always start to lose the thread around the 3rd/4th century AD, after Constantine, with the continuous sacking of Rome and Italy going on by virtually everyone. And so most of the histories that I read, I gut it out until 476, when Odoacer beats Romulus Augustulus to declare himself King of Italy, and the Roman Empire dead.</p>\n<p>So I was really interested to read this book, which is a history that goes from the establishment of the Roman capital in the East (Byzantium, to be later renamed Constantinople), initially by Diocletian, and consolidated later by Constantine, through the fall of the Constantinople in 1453 (when Mehmet II defeated Constantine XI).</p>\n<p>I really, really liked this book. It suffers a little bit from over-focusing on emperors and generals, but I learned a <i>lot</i> about how to think about the parts of the empire, and later the relationship between the Crusaders, Islam, and the Eastern Roman Empire, led from Constantinople. I hadn't really thought too much about how the lineage from Rome affected how Constantinople viewed the world, or the nuanced way it sat between East &amp; West. (And, to be honest, my geography of the region needed a bit of a refresher, as I always think that Turkey &amp; Constantinople are further to the east than they actually are.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you're a roman history nerd like me, and don't mind reading about 11 different Constantines over the course of a thousand years or so, this is a great book to pick up. (\"great e-book to download\"? how are we going to talk about books in our digital future??)</p>\n",

Tim is a professor at Columbia Law School, and one of the most advanced thinkers about a number of technology network effects, but especially Net Neutrality.</p>\n<p>It's a history of various information technology waves, from the telephone to movies to television to the Internet, some analysis of what's happening in today's landscape with Google and Apple and others, and some of Wu's suggestions for how to create more effective public policy in the future. I loved the first part (although I'm a technology history nerd of first order), and found the part about the current landscape interesting but already a bit out of date, and probably not as deep an analysis as I was hoping for. The prescriptions he outlines I thought weren't quite right. I had a hard time really understanding how to think about the remedies he was suggesting, and how they could really work.</p>\n<p>But overall, fantastic book, and has changed the way I think about technology waves.</p>\n<p>While I was at Mozilla day-to-day, when I talked about open and closed systems, I would say something like this: new technologies (e.g. the PC, the smart phone, the tablet, etc etc) nearly always start closed and proprietary -- it's easier to create something completely new that's innovative and disruptive if you control all the pieces, aren't trying overmuch to play nicely with others. But then over time, technology tends to open up, as the techniques become more widely undertsood, horizontal layers come in to drive costs down and increase variety of solutions, etc. The interesting variable in every technology wave, I said, was how long and messy the \"middle\" between open and closed is -- and of course, Mozilla's mission with respect to the Web was to make the proprietary phase as short as possible, and get to open as quickly as we could.</p>\n<p>After reading Wu's book, I still think that's essentially true, but not really the whole story. I now think technology waves tend to go from closed/proprietary to open <i>and then back to closed, based around the strength of network distribution.</i> In other words, and especially with communications and information technology, you tend to go from proprietary invention to open innovation and then things settle down as a small number of players control the distribution of content on their own networks based on the open technologies. These networks then tend to be few in number, and <i>overwhelmingly dominant</i> in their control over how people experience the technology and content.</p>\n<p>The only thing that really unseats these networks is the rise of the next technology wave -- that's possible because successive technology waves tend to be much larger than what came before. That's what's happening now, with mobile completely overwhelming the previous waves of computing, being available to more people, more of the time, with more touch points in their lives.</p>\n<p>And that's why the fight between Apple, Google and Facebook is so, so fierce. Everyone is trying to move from the current wave of IT into the mobile one. Everyone is trying to become dominant, in order to take the wins from the network effects from the PC/Web battles and use them to win the next Mobile/Networked battle.</p>\n<p>[As an aside, it's tough to imagine what technology wave will displace billions of people carrying smart phones (little network connected computers) around with them all the time, but what we do know is this: <i>it will happen.</i> Some giant new information tech wave will eventually make this mobile technology boom, which looks absolutely massive to us now, look small in retrospect. It's the nature of communications technology.]</p>\n<p>Another thing that's clear as you look at historical technology waves is that they're getting shorter. Disruption is coming faster and faster. This, too, is an intuitive result. Each technology wave means that we're able to communicate and collaborate more effectively and more quickly.</p>\n<p>Companies that are dominant in one wave do not tend to be dominant in those following. They can be relevant, and even <i>extremely</i> relevant, but they don't tend to dominate in the same way. Lots of reasons for that. They've got existing businesses to protect. They're built on previous models of efficiency optimized for previous waves. They get big and complex and tired. I'm beginning to think that companies don't dominate like this because not only are their innovators dilemma issues inherent in moving from one wave to the next, but also because you've got to not just jump waves, but also go through the closed-open-closed cycles of the new technology, and that's an unnatural set of transitions to go through.</p>\n<p>What I find so interesting about our current context -- everyone who was dominant in the PC/Web era moving to the mobile era -- is that they're trying to jump directly to the closed network phase. Mobile systems right now look extremely vertically integrated, from services to servers to devices to content. I can't yet discern the really open phase of mobile. I believe it will come, but it's hard to see quite how right now, and I think this \"open\" battle between Apple and Google is really just prelude.</p>\n<p>But who knows. It's an exciting time to be alive and working. Every day I wake up and meet people who are building technologies and products that promise to completely rework the way we interact with our world and with each other. It feels like so much open water here; everything seems up for grabs.</p>\n<p>I can't recommend reading Tim Wu's book highly enough. Whether you agree or disagree with any particular bit of it isn't that important. Thinking about the technology waves that have come before help us think about what might come next, and how they might feel.</p>\n",

I kept brushing him off &ndash; I thought my path was going to be in (what I thought was the significantly more technical and higher impact world of) computer architecture design (RISC is the future!).</p>\n<p>There were two events that were pivotal for me (beyond Sean&rsquo;s good-natured prodding). [and a short aside here is in order &ndash; not only did Sean affect what my course of study would be, but about a decade later, having not been in touch for many years, out of the blue Sean sent an e-mail introducing me to someone named Reid Hoffman, then an exec at PayPal.

At the time it was obvious that Silicon Graphics was the important competitor and that hardware architecture was the important thing to work on. (Note to self: what seems completely, totally obvious today often seems pretty ridiculous in hindsight.) But fortunately that was a time when Scott McNealy was CEO and he really opened up the place to interns &ndash; he really encouraged us to poke around inside Sun, to talk with interesting people, and to generally make nuisances of ourselves. One of the guys I&rsquo;m sure I annoyed was Bob Glass, a UI designer nicknamed &ldquo;Dr. Bob&rdquo; who had come to Sun from Apple to &ldquo;drain the swamp or pave it over&rdquo; &ndash; talking about the crappy UIs that Unix always had (especially) compared to Apple. Clearly, he didn&rsquo;t really win that particular battle, but he framed an important problem for me as we talked in his office.

And as we&rsquo;ve been answering, what&rsquo;s become clear to me is this: parenting is a series of decisions that could have profound implications years from now that you have no way of really, truly understanding now. There&rsquo;s an unfortunate lack of data on what works in education generally, let alone in language immersion programs.</p>\n<p>(Although it&rsquo;s important to say this: we know a LOT more about what works in education than we actually use in practice. Lots and lots of reasons for this: many are industry structural, many are cultural &ndash; we have a lot to learn about best practices in teaching still, in a data-and-outcome-oriented way &ndash; but it would be a big step to be able to use what we DO know.)</p>\n<p>In the case of SPL and Mandarin, we really are excited about it, and SPL is, too. But it&rsquo;s very hard to tell what it will mean in the long term. It&rsquo;s been really clear so far that learning Chinese and English at the same time (since he was about 3) has been challenging, and that it&rsquo;s affected the order of his skill development (in particular in terms of reading and writing, since he&rsquo;s learning a couple of very different systems simultaneously). There&rsquo;s some new research that suggests that in general, dual-language learners develop more slowly in terms of reading &amp; writing until about 4th grade, at which point they catch up and develop normally. There&rsquo;s other literature that suggests that kids who grow up bilingual have better executive function as adults, presumably because their brains become good at making snap decisions on which language to use in any given situation.</p>\n<p>But in truth, who the hell knows? The data sets we have on this stuff are vanishingly small. As I wrote about Ohlone, in our experience there just aren&rsquo;t any other schools that are constructivist and whole child and Mandarin immersion &ndash; so the data we have to look at is really just the 4 classes that have come before us. So we&rsquo;ll see.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not saying we haven&rsquo;t worked the angles on this. Like so many of our friends, we can be a little, um&hellip;detail-obsessed and maybe even have OCD tendencies. And since Kathy&rsquo;s a teacher, you might imagine that we&rsquo;ve done a lot of thinking and talking about this with lots of friends and educators. And so we have good feelings about it, based on pretty good reasoning.</p>\n<p>In that way, parenting is sort of like trying to operate a startup. You never have nearly the information you need to make decisions; and lots of times when you&rsquo;re trying to make certain decisions you not only don&rsquo;t even understand the implications of what you&rsquo;re deciding, but often don&rsquo;t even really understand the data that you think you do.</p>\n<p>So now we&rsquo;re off to the races. Will SPL embrace his Chinese over the years? Will he work in China 20 years from now? Will he reject it like so many kids reject piano lessons? How will it affect the way he thinks, the way he looks at the world, the way he makes his own way?</p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know &ndash; we&rsquo;ve really got no idea at all. But that&rsquo;s sort of the mystery and the magic of it. We&rsquo;ll learn as we go. Nobody&rsquo;s seen this particular movie before, and that&rsquo;ll make it challenging, and interesting, and human.</p>\n",

And since Kathy's a teacher, you might imagine that we've done a lot of thinking and talking about this with lots of friends and educators. And so we have good feelings about it, based on pretty good reasoning.\n\nIn that way, parenting is sort of like trying to operate a startup. You never have nearly the information you need to make decisions; and lots of times when you're trying to make certain decisions you not only don't even understand the implications of what you're deciding, but often don't even really understand the data that you think you do.\n\nSo now we're off to the races. Will SPL embrace his Chinese over the years? Will he work in China 20 years from now? Will he reject it like so many kids reject piano lessons? How will it affect the way he thinks, the way he looks at the world, the way he makes his own way?\n\nWe don't know -- we've really got no idea at all. But that's sort of the mystery and the magic of it. We'll learn as we go. Nobody's seen this particular movie before, and that'll make it challenging, and interesting, and human.\n",

Joshua Foer is a journalist (and younger brother of Jonathan Safran Foer, one of my favorite novelists) who was covering the US Memory Championships one year -- an annual contest of around 3 dozen \"Memory Athletes\" who compete to see who can memorize the most digits in five minutes, the order of a deck of cards the quickest, and other contests like that.</p>\n<p>While covering the event, he got interested in how memory itself works -- can it be learned &amp; trained? -- and in the subculture of the memory athletes themselves. So he decided to train for the championship the following year, and to enter it himself.</p>\n<p>I love books like this -- coverage of deep subcultures of our society that are funny, but without making fun of them. (Candy Freak, by Steve Almond, is one of my favorites.) Here's what he said about the contest itself: \"The demographics of your average memory contest are pretty much indistinguishable from those of a 'Weird Al' Yankovic (five of spades) concert. An overwhelming number of contestants are young, white, male juggling aficionados.\"</p>\n<p>Lots of interesting stuff in this one, including going through some of the systems for memorizing long strings of items. The millennia old Memory Palace technique, the newer (just a few hundred years old) Major Method, or the even newer PAO system (that the title of the book alludes to). A fair amount of coverage (but not all that deep) on how our memories work, what happens when parts of our brains are damaged, etc.</p>\n<p>One of the funniest realizations in the book: \"Not long after returning from England, I found myself sitting on a folding chair in the basement of my parents’ home at 6:45 a.m., wearing underpants, earmuffs, and memory goggles, with a printout of eight hundred random digits in my lap and an image in my mind’s eye of a lingerie-clad garden gnome (52632) suspended over my grandmother’s kitchen table. I suddenly looked up, wondering—remarkably, for the first time—what in the world I was doing with myself.\"</p>\n<p>He also included a chapter on his conversations with Gordon Bell, early at DEC and of late trying to record and externalize all his experiences and memories, so he can recall everything that's happened to him with a few keystrokes. There are threads in the book that talk about how we read today compared to how we used to read (internalized versus externalized), and what memories are for at all. Some profundities for sure, like this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><span class=\"highlight\">\"So why bother investing in one’s memory in an age of externalized memories? The best answer I can give is the one that I received unwittingly from EP, whose memory had been so completely lost that he could not place himself in time or space, or relative to other people. That is: How we perceive the world and how we act in it are products of how and what we remember. We’re all just a bundle of habits shaped by our memories. And to the extent that we control our lives, we do so by gradually altering those habits, which is to say the networks of our memory. No lasting joke, invention, insight, or work of art was ever produced by an external memory. Not yet, at least. Our ability to find humor in the world, to make connections between previously unconnected notions, to create new ideas, to share in a common culture: All these essentially human acts depend on memory. Now more than ever, as the role of memory in our culture erodes at a faster pace than ever before, we need to cultivate our ability to remember. Our memories make us who we are. They are the seat of our values and source of our character. Competing to see who can memorize more pages of poetry might seem beside the point, but it’s about taking a stand against forgetfulness, and embracing primal capacities from which too many of us have become estranged. That’s what Ed</span> had been trying to impart to me from the beginning: that memory training is not just for the sake of performing party tricks; it’s about nurturing something profoundly and essentially human.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But mostly just a fun journey through a subculture that most of us haven't ever experienced. Very quick to read; both fun and worthwhile.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m at the airport waiting for my flight home from TED 2011, my third trip to TED. TED is an amazing conference and community - every time I&rsquo;ve been it&rsquo;s been different but also a little bit the same.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the videos for several years, of course - they&rsquo;re a monumental source of inspiration and erudition and passion and intellect - not to mention sort of a master&rsquo;s class in presentation skills. So when I was able to attend for the first time in 2009, it was a little mind blowing. I was overwhelmed with everything. The content, the experience, the caliber of attendees, everything. Browsing the bookstore with Peter Gabriel. Sitting behind Paul Simon for one of the sessions. Using a urinal next to Bill Gates. (it seemed notable at the time. Now not so much.) Everything was overwhelming. I spent the week just soaking it all up, attending most every presentation and just loving it all.</p>\n<p>My second time, in 2010, was really different. I had decided I was going to leave Mozilla, and so a lot of what I was starting to work on was figuring out how to make that happen in the best possible way. That meant I was working more - doing email, talking with people to brainstorm about potential candidates, etc. TED is structured physically in a really interesting way - there&rsquo;s the main auditorium where many people watch the talks, but there are also many spaces around the auditorium and even in tents outside where the talks are simulcast and provide spaces to work without bothering other audience members. It&rsquo;s a way to watch but with a little less investment; it&rsquo;s also a way to be more social as you process the content. And of course it&rsquo;s a way to watch with friends. So I didn&rsquo;t connect with as much of the speaker content then as I had the previous year, but a couple of talks were revelatory, and I noted a bunch of them to watch later (which I did for the most part.)</p>\n<p>This year felt different yet again. It was my first time here that I felt, more than anything, like it was a gathering of my community, of my friends, and I felt like part of it, rather than attending a conference. I happened to know a few of the speakers and got to talk with them both before and after their talks. Instead of just being excited to be around folks, I got into really, really interesting conversations with them about areas of their expertise, of my expertise, and then a bunch of areas where none of us knew much of anything. (I felt particularly lucky to spend time with Mohamed Nanabhay head of Al Jazeera English online - and to hear him talk about what it was like in the Doha newsroom when Mubarak left. Inspiring.) Like last year, though, I worked quite a bit, whether it was talking with other technologists and investors or paying attention to my e-mail. As a result, I again felt a little distanced from the content unfortunately, except for a few of the sessions. That&rsquo;s something I plan to change next year - I&rsquo;ll still have plenty of work to do, but I&rsquo;m going to work hard to make sure that when I&rsquo;m around the presentations that I let myself engage, focus, and let the content surround me more.</p>\n<p>Even so, TED has a way of sneaking up on you, and the last day was tremendously inspiring. Was great to hear Jack Horner talking about building dinosaurs out of chickens (and I&rsquo;m excited to visit him in Montana this summer). Was amazing to hear General McChrystal talk about leadership, and Kathryn Schulz talk about being wrong. But the last two talks were the gems for me. John Hunter, a 4th grade teacher from Virginia got up to talk about his &ldquo;Peace Game,&rdquo; which he&rsquo;s been using to teach for 30 years. (there&rsquo;s a documentary about him called World Peace and other 4th Grade Accomplishments). Hard to summarize, but take my word for it: watch it when it&rsquo;s released online. We need more teachers like John getting their voices heard by folks more often. It&rsquo;s very very easy to be discouraged and cynical about the state of education today - I often am myself - but that glosses over the fact that there are thousands - tens of thousands - of minor miracles happening every day in our classrooms. There are thousands of incredible, inspirational, talented teachers who are helping our kids understand, and build, and become. The system is busted, sure. But there are teachers like John who are revelatory, and they should get more chances for their voices to be heard and inspire us all.</p>\n<p>The conference finished up with a Roger Ebert, who talked quite literally, about losing his own voice and finding it again. As he noted himself, it&rsquo;s a little tough to look at him - he lost his jaw to cancer several years ago, nearly died several times, and can no longer eat, drink or speak. But the guy has always been an incredible communicator, and still is. When they were setting up for his talk, they put 4 chairs on stage, which had me scratching my head. He came in and sat down and (of course) played a movie clip from 2001 of HAL being shut down. Then 3 people joined him: his wife, Dean Ornish, and John Hunter (who I mentioned above). And they brought out his MacBook for him. He used the voice synthesizer on his laptop to start his talk - and he provided a sort of narration on top by using his (very expressive) facial expressions as an accompaniment. Then, as he noted that synthesized voices tend to put people to sleep, he had his wife, Dean, and John each read parts of his talk for him, again, adding his own visual expressions as they went. The talk was about, in the main, his journey of losing his voice to using technology like voice synthesis and blogs and Twitter to find it again. It was a wonderful meditation on what it means to literally lose your voice, and to look disabled but not to think that way. The most emotional part of the week was experiencing his wife reading his words about how others see him now, disfigured, and the assumptions that he sees them make. She had to pause for part &ndash; it was the most amazing thing to watch. Because Roger had written very matter-of-fact words about how people perceive him present state - they assume he&rsquo;s broken in other ways - and he seems to have come to peace with it. But watching the emotion from his wife as she tried to read those words - what was incredibly, incredibly clear is that she doesn&rsquo;t seem him in that way at all, doesn&rsquo;t think that others do, that she hurts that he feels this way about his relationship to the world, whether he&rsquo;s at peace with it or not. And mostly that she just really loves him in a profound way. It was a beautiful, touching thing to experience - I was pretty much a wreck, and I&rsquo;m sure that most everyone in attendance was.</p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing about TED. Every time I go, there are at least a couple of experiences that I have that change the way that I look at the world, the way that I want to be when I go home. TED makes you want to be better, smarter, more present, more thoughtful, more impactful, more human. To be a better citizen and a better professional and a better dad and a better husband and a better friend. That type of inspiration doesn&rsquo;t happen all that much, and it&rsquo;s worth the price of admission every time.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s why June Cohen and Tom Rielly, on the TED team are two of my true heroes. They both have chosen to spend their lives working on building up TED outside of just the week of the conference every year. Tom has built the TED Fellows program, which started out pretty damn great and at this point is starting to move into basically ass-kicking-terrifyingly-awesome territory. And June, who put TED Talks online for everyone to see, including subtitling into 80+ languages.</p>\n<p>That, my friends, is how you change the world.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s how you take this beautiful, wonderful experience for a few people in California each year and turn it into something that anyone &ndash; anyone! &ndash; can use to make themselves, their community, their world better themselves.</p>\n",

Absolutely, 100% infuriating to read, as so many of the people involved in the financial system collapse were idiots at best and criminal at worst - but of course they took home big paydays. I really recommend this book -- it was easier to read than Sorkin's <i>Too Big to Fail,</i> which was good, but ultimately a little too chatty. While Sorkin's book focused mostly on the heads of the banks, Lewis instead focused on the guys on the outside who figured out early how busted the markets were and who were able to take out big bets against the system. They were all, by definition, outsiders and misfits -- and ultimately while they made the situation worse, they weren't really fundamentally responsible.</p>\n<p>Anyway, everyone should understand what this book is about, and how profoundly we were let down by those in positions of power, again &amp; again.</p>\n",

I&rsquo;m quoted in it a little bit, so figured I would write some about the conversation I had with the writer and some thoughts that didn&rsquo;t make it into the piece.</p>\n<p>I talked with Mickey (the author) while I was taking time off between Mozilla and Greylock, right after I had written <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this blog post on disconnecting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I got connected to her via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bob Sutton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who&rsquo;s in the article as well, and who&rsquo;s always thoughtful and very quotable. Before I took off for vacation, my partner David Sze suggested to me that I totally disconnect from everything, saying that I would find the silence precious. He was right, for sure &ndash; but I just couldn&rsquo;t really figure out how to do it. Too much of my life now is tangled up in e-mail, Twitter, Facebook, others. I think of myself as essentially an introvert, but I get a lot out of having the social connectivity that I do online. It&rsquo;s all just become a part of my life that is very, very hard to turn off &ndash; it&rsquo;s a little bit like turning off &ldquo;talking to the neighbors,&rdquo; at least for me.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t really tell you if this is good, bad or indifferent &ndash; it is what it is. It does feel different than even a couple of years ago. As I mentioned in the article, it&rsquo;s become a sort of &ldquo;peripheral vision&rdquo; &ndash; I can generally keep track of how people I care about and work with are feeling by reading what they tweet about and share on Facebook. How much they&rsquo;re sharing is pertinent, too &ndash; you can sort of see some of the ebbs and flows of peoples' lives.</p>\n<p>One of the things that didn&rsquo;t make it into the article is that I found engaging on Twitter indispensable for managing effectively at Mozilla. Hewlett &amp; Packard used to talk about &ldquo;managing by walking around&rdquo; &ndash; the idea that the best way to understand what&rsquo;s happening in an organization is just to walk around and observe it yourself. To meet people where they work, to talk with them about whatever is on their mind, to ask lots of questions. I really, really believe in doing that &ndash; more than being useful, I just really enjoyed doing it.</p>\n<p>With so many Mozillians distributed around the world, living in Twitter became a modern sort of walking around for me. I followed and interacted with dozens of folks this way over the last couple of years.

				"content_text": "In today's New York Times Business Section, there's a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/business/06limits.html\">piece on the current state of work life balance</a>, in an age of iPhones and Twitter (more or less). I'm quoted in it a little bit, so figured I would write some about the conversation I had with the writer and some thoughts that didn't make it into the piece.\n\nI talked with Mickey (the author) while I was taking time off between Mozilla and Greylock, right after I had written <a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2011/01/03/slowing-down-my-clock/\">this blog post on disconnecting</a>. I got connected to her via <a href=\"http://bobsutton.typepad.com/\">Bob Sutton</a>, who's in the article as well, and who's always thoughtful and very quotable. Before I took off for vacation, my partner David Sze suggested to me that I totally disconnect from everything, saying that I would find the silence precious. He was right, for sure -- but I just couldn't really figure out how to do it. Too much of my life now is tangled up in e-mail, Twitter, Facebook, others. I think of myself as essentially an introvert, but I get a lot out of having the social connectivity that I do online. It's all just become a part of my life that is very, very hard to turn off -- it's a little bit like turning off \"talking to the neighbors,\" at least for me.\n\nI can't really tell you if this is good, bad or indifferent -- it is what it is. It does feel different than even a couple of years ago. As I mentioned in the article, it's become a sort of \"peripheral vision\" -- I can generally keep track of how people I care about and work with are feeling by reading what they tweet about and share on Facebook. How much they're sharing is pertinent, too -- you can sort of see some of the ebbs and flows of peoples' lives.\n\nOne of the things that didn't make it into the article is that I found engaging on Twitter indispensable for managing effectively at Mozilla. Hewlett &amp; Packard used to talk about \"managing by walking around\" -- the idea that the best way to understand what's happening in an organization is just to walk around and observe it yourself. To meet people where they work, to talk with them about whatever is on their mind, to ask lots of questions. I really, really believe in doing that -- more than being useful, I just really enjoyed doing it.\n\nWith so many Mozillians distributed around the world, living in Twitter became a modern sort of walking around for me. I followed and interacted with dozens of folks this way over the last couple of years. Clearly, not everyone was there -- and we have a couple of other online forums that are probably even more important (IRC &amp; Bugzilla) -- but many were. And it was a great way to understand what was top of mind for folks, to understand who was feeling discouraged, who was feeling ready for new things. And just to commune with each other, really. I learned a lot by thinking about it that way.\n\nMozilla is unusual in its openness, so it's hard for me to completely generalize from that experience -- because of the open product roadmap and the open community involvement, doing all this stuff on the public internet was pretty natural. Obviously many (most?) companies won't be able to do it quite like this.

The course is on &ldquo;scaling&rdquo; &ndash; an over-used word, but one that Huggy&rsquo;s been really digging into lately &ndash; resulting in some great insights. This particular class covered a case study authored by Huggy with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bob Sutton<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the rise of Mozilla and Firefox, so it was fun to participate in.</p>\n<p>Huggy asked me to do a quick 10 minute introduction to the class. I chose to talk about the differences between then and now &ndash; how much has changed in the 5.5 years since Firefox&rsquo;s initial 1.0, and what the new challenges of scaling are. So, naturally, my first comment to the students was that most of the case was irrelevant to today&rsquo;s world. That Mozilla was amazing and unique and special &ndash; for lots of reasons that include (1) breaking the MS/IE monopoly distribution and usage of the browser, (2) doing it in a way that enabled lots of innovation and competition that we&rsquo;re seeing now, and (3) finding our own way through the journey &ndash; not behaving like anyone else in the market ever really has. So that&rsquo;s cool. In that battle, though, access to users was probably the biggest challenge &ndash; it looked impossible when Mozilla started, and it&rsquo;s remarkable &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->incredible, really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; that we ultimately have gotten the reach we have.</p>\n<p>But fast forward to today&rsquo;s world, where we have more than 600M users on Facebook, more than 400M users of Firefox, and networks like LinkedIn and Twitter with global reach of a hundred million or more. Combine that with the rise of the Apple App Store and mobile devices &ndash; with something approaching 200M user accounts that all have credit cards associated with them. (And if there&rsquo;s any doubt, these numbers are truly huge. I put in some cultural references in my talk &ndash; about 100M people will watch the SuperBowl. And only about 20M watch the nightly news in America; 30M listen to NPR. We think of these institutions as huge, but they&rsquo;re nowhere near Internet scale at this point. The new networks have left them behind, quite handily.)</p>\n<p>So now a huge part of the world is accessible, a huge part of the world is ready and able to download an app or click on a shared link. Which means that access is no longer the chief initial obstacle to scaling. That means you can see companies like Zynga or Groupon rise from nothing to massive practically overnight. Clearly, the initial challenge is about rising above the noise of an increasingly crowded field of ways for people to spend their time and money, but it&rsquo;s very, very possible to get to tens or hundreds of millions of users quickly. Which means that now you&rsquo;ve got companies that are dealing with huge, complex, global user bases at an extremely early point in their history. My view is that scaling successfully &ndash; which means sustaining that scale over time &ndash; will be dependent on figuring out how to make the teams and processes in rocket ship organizations operate effectively.</p>\n<p>I know not all the analogies in the slides are apples-to-apples, but what&rsquo;s clear is that we&rsquo;re living in an era of hyper-distribution, where things can change very, very quickly. I&rsquo;m really glad that smart people like Huggy and Bob are thinking about how to help us all learn how to manage these in the future.</p>\n<p>Fun conversation, thanks to Huggy for the invitation! My few slides are below &ndash; they&rsquo;re very incomplete and mostly served to provoke some interesting discussion. (PS &ndash; the deck is sort of a tweener deck graphically between my Mozilla-style slides and what I&rsquo;ll use here at Greylock &ndash; haven&rsquo;t been here long enough to monkey with the Greylock slides yet. :-))</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

My view is that scaling successfully -- which means sustaining that scale over time -- will be dependent on figuring out how to make the teams and processes in rocket ship organizations operate effectively.\n\nI know not all the analogies in the slides are apples-to-apples, but what's clear is that we're living in an era of hyper-distribution, where things can change very, very quickly. I'm really glad that smart people like Huggy and Bob are thinking about how to help us all learn how to manage these in the future.\n\nFun conversation, thanks to Huggy for the invitation! My few slides are below -- they're very incomplete and mostly served to provoke some interesting discussion. (PS -- the deck is sort of a tweener deck graphically between my Mozilla-style slides and what I'll use here at Greylock -- haven't been here long enough to monkey with the Greylock slides yet. :-))\n<div id=\"__ss_6767384\" style=\"width:425px;\">\n<strong style=\"display:block;margin:12px 0 4px;\"><a title=\"Mozilla and Scaling\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/johnolilly/mozilla-and-scaling\">Mozilla and Scaling</a></strong><a href=\"http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=gsb01272011-110131173024-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=mozilla-and-scaling&amp;userName=johnolilly\">http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=gsb01272011-110131173024-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=mozilla-and-scaling&amp;userName=johnolilly</a>\n<div style=\"padding:5px 0 12px;\">View more <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\">presentations</a> from <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/johnolilly\">John Lilly</a>.</div>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've been meaning to pick up a <a href=\"http://www.drobo.com/\">Drobo</a> for our house for quite some time -- thanks to Aneel I finally got one last week -- and, as I share below, I really, really like it. They've done a great job, and it should be a great storage and backup solution for us for a long time to come.</p>\n<p>[quick disclosure: <a href=\"http://www.greylock.com\">Greylock Partners</a>, where I work, is an investor in Drobo.]</p>\n<p>First off: Drobo is essentially a big box of hard disks that acts like a single disk. It uses a non-RAID technology called BeyondRAID to spread out data in a way that if 1 disk fails, you can still get to all your data. (There's also a setting so that you can make it robust to 2 simultaneous drive failures, but that's not the default, or what I've set mine on.)</p>\n<p>It also has an extremely nice characteristic that you can always hot swap any drive for a replacement or a bigger drive if you run out of space. (Just another step towards robots being in control -- when the Drobo needs more space, it blinks a yellow light at you, effectively saying, \"Human, I require more disk -- please run down to Fry's and deposit the new disk beside my blinky light. That is all.\" I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the Drobo. I chose the Drobo S, which is a 5 bay unit that's direct attached to a machine via eSATA, Firewire 800 or USB3. I dithered back and forth on whether to choose that one or the Drobo FS, which runs everything over Gigabit Ethernet as a networked file server. I chose the direct attached because we have an iMac that's pretty much always on, and the vast majority of the data we want to store on the Drobo is from the iMac -- and I figured this would be a simpler configuration. I'm still on the fence -- I think I would have been just as happy with the FS.</p>\n<p>The out of box experience with the Drobo is exceptionally good. The packaging is more like a consumer device, with easy-to-follow 1-2-3 steps on top, clearly marked, and the Drobo itself wrapped in a protective cloth. Essentially, here's the process:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>insert the disks into the Drobo (in my case, 5 1TB Quantums)</li>\n\n  <li>install the Drobo software onto the host computer</li>\n\n  <li>plug it in</li>\n\n  <li>run the Drobo dashboard to specify how you want the partitioning scheme to work, etc</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Altogether, took about 10 minutes, and the Drobo was happily running, showing to my iMac as a 16 TB volume (even though I've got 5 TB of physical space and more like 3.7 TB of logical space once you factor in the redundancy).</p>\n<p>That was really it -- it couldn't have been simpler. No complicated decisions, no significant forward looking capacity planning, no nothing. When the yellow blinky light comes on, I'll feed it more disk.</p>\n<p>To my mind, this is really the only solution there is that's simple, performant, stable, expandable, redundant, and not incredibly industrial and expensive. It's quiet (much quieter than I expected for 5 drives running) and doesn't get hot, and so far has been pretty good about spinning down after disuse. (It could be more aggressive there, but might be pilot error on my part -- need to look into it.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I like it a bunch.</p>\n<p><b>Using it for backup with Time Machine</b></p>\n<p>It's worth talking about my use case here, since there is a minor wrinkle. The reason that I'm so excited &amp; interested in home storage is that our family's data needs are growing, quickly. We've got about 40k digital photos that are getting increasingly large per picture. We're taking more and more HD video with our Canon 7D. Most everything we watch for SPL that isn't streamed is ripped from other sources and stored. In fact, in the year or so since we got our iMac with what I thought was a pretty reasonably sized 2 TB disk, we've gone from about 600 GB of stuff to 1.3 TB.</p>\n<p>It's harder than you might think to regularly and reliably back up 1.3 TB in your house.</p>\n<p>We had a 2 TB external drive that was doing it for a while, but that's not really big enough once your main data set is over a terabyte, especially with Apple's Time Machine, since it's pretty aggressive about making deltas every hour, day, week, etc. So we needed something bigger than that, but the 3 TB drives aren't too available yet, and I wasn't really all that keen on replacing that one again in a year or so as our data grew.</p>\n<p>Which is why the Drobo is perfect. Just add disks as I want backup to scale.</p>\n<p>There is a small problem though, in the interaction between the design of the Drobo and the design of Time Machine. The Drobo just wants to be the biggest disk it can be -- up to (at least) 16 TB, so it tells the iMac to just keep giving it data, letting it (and you, human with a car and a credit card) take care of the physical details.</p>\n<p>Time Machine is designed to find an external disk (that you select), start putting files on it and then putting new (or changed) files on it again and again and again until it fills up the disk. So that's a virtue if you've got a dedicated disk that's backing your data up, to a point.</p>\n<p>But since the Drobo advertises to the iMac that it's a 16 TB disk, and Time Machine hasn't really learned limits yet, Time Machine will happily fill up your physical space, which will cause your yellow Drobo light to come on, which will cause you to install a new disk (and repeat, and repeat), all the way up to the 16 TB that's the maximum.</p>\n<p>So that's not great. What you really want to be able to do is to tell Time Machine to just use a certain amount of space and then start rewriting over older copies. There's no way to do that at present in the Time Machine settings (which I feel is silly -- with big disks like Drobo, it's an easy thing to add), so you have to instead make Time Machine think it's got a smaller disk than it does.</p>\n<p>2 ways to do that: (1) partition the Drobo into a logical Time Machine volume, or (2) use sparse bundles. I didn't want to do the first one, because in the future I might want to expand the Time Machine volume, which would mean repartitioning the Drobo, and losing my data in the process.</p>\n<p>But sparse bundles (or, more precisely, sparse images), which I also use to encrypt my work and personal directories on my laptop, do the trick perfectly. With a sparse image, you can set up something that looks like a disk to your Mac, with an optional maximum size that you set, but that only takes up the space that it's actually using.</p>\n<p>So I set up a 3.5 TB sparse image that Time Machine backs up to -- as it gets to full, it'll do the right thing, keep the total backup space used under 3.5 TB, no problem. <i>And I can resize the sparse image at any time in the future from the Terminal.</i></p>\n<p>And that's working perfectly at this point.</p>\n<p>I used an <a href=\"http://www.drobo.com/droboapps/downloads/index.php?id=16\">Automator script called Time Tamer</a> to do things pretty automatically for me. And there's a good discussion of some of this stuff on a couple of blogs -- <a href=\"http://nslog.com/2008/11/11/formatting_the_drobo_for_time_machine_backups\">this one</a> was most helpful to me.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: the Drobo S is going to be perfect for us, and I couldn't be happier to have it. I know it's decidedly nerdy to get excited about a storage solution, but there you have it. :-)</p>\n",

Cleopatra's life has been chronicled by <i>many --</i> very often writers with political or cultural agendas -- so it's always been tough to get a fair picture of her. Further, her story is almost always told in the context of the history of the end of the Roman Republic -- the decades of civil war that resulted in Octavian \"restoring the Republic\" by becoming Emperor Augustus.</p>\n<p>This book is neat because it really focuses on Cleopatra, Egypt, and her Ptolemaic/Hellenistic context, with (principally) Caesar and Marc Antony as the 2 Roman figures who she would have extremely significant relationships with.</p>\n<p>I found the beginning of the book to be terrific because it gave me a ton of context of Egyptian &amp; Ptolemaic history that I didn't really know. The middle was a little bit of a slog, between Caesar's death and the real hostilities between Antony &amp; Octavian. The end was incredible -- a real page turner, even though I knew most of what would ultimately happen.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure you'll love this book if you don't also really enjoy Roman history, and as I mentioned the middle was a little slow - but overall I really enjoyed it, and it's significantly changed the way that I view that 20-30 years of world history generally and Roman history specifically.</p>\n",

				"title": "Ohlone Letter to Palo Alto School Board",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>The main reason we moved to Palo Alto is for the public school options for SPL; the most compelling for us is a progressive school started in 1976 called <a href=\"http://ohlone.pausd.org/\">Ohlone Elementary</a>. Particularly compelling is a program within that school: their <a href=\"http://ohlone.pausd.org/mandarinimmersion.html\">Mandarin Immersion program</a>. For a lot of reasons I'll maybe put into another post, we decided some time ago that it was important for SPL to grow up as bilingual (at least) as possible, and that Mandarin made the most sense as a 2nd language. Easier said than done, but at this point, at the age of 5 1/2, he's reasonably fluent (we think), and we're working hard on finding ways to support more over time. Ohlone is a unique program that blends progressive instruction with Mandarin immersion -- it was started 3 years ago by some amazing people, including a friend of ours.</p>\n<p>At the Palo Alto Unified School District board meeting this past Tuesday, the board took up the question of whether to change the status of this Mandarin program from essentially a startup to ongoing status. Even though we had literally just finished up with the movers to our new house, we wanted to participate, so I went to speak, and what I said, essentially, is that we moved here for the chance to participate in the program (it's a lottery, so chances are uncertain) -- and that it's a critically important and unique type of program, but that it <i>shouldn't</i> be unique. We need more kids getting more chances to build more comprehensive world views, and that starts with language.</p>\n<p>Happily, the board approved a change to ongoing status for the program -- a huge milestone for the startup program here.</p>\n<p>Kathy &amp; I also sent a letter to the school board prior to the meeting -- I'll share it below.</p>\n<p>Congrats to Ohlone!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>December 7, 2010</p>\n<p>Palo Alto Unified School District Board<br>\n25 Churchill Avenue<br>\nPalo Alto, CA 94306</p>\n<p>Dear Board Members:</p>\n<p>After living for 10 years in Sunnyvale, and more than 20 in the Bay Area, my husband John &amp; I are moving to Palo Alto this week to give our 5 year old SPL the best opportunity for an exceptionally high quality public education in the area. And the specific school and program we’re most interested in is the Mandarin Immersion program at Ohlone Elementary. I’d like to share a bit of background on why we think it’s such a uniquely important program to support - for our own family, for children of Palo Alto, and for education overall.</p>\n<p>Neither my husband nor I have any Chinese background at all; I grew up in San Antonio and my husband lived in many states growing up, as his father was in the Air Force. I’m an educator and have taught science at several levels in the Bay Area and internationally. As a teacher over the last 15 years (and currently mentor teacher in East Palo Alto), I’ve built up significant theory and practice and have a strong belief in constructivist practice, as well as a strong focus on social-emotional learning, so you can see why we’re so interested in Ohlone generally.</p>\n<p>For my husband, in his job as CEO of Mozilla the last few years, he’s been traveling and working internationally quite extensively, including helping to set up their office in Beijing and working to build their Chinese efforts since 2007. He’s now transitioning from his Mozilla role to a new one as a venture investor at Greylock Partners, and China figures to be a large influence in that role as well.</p>\n<p>As you might imagine, once we decided that we wanted a bilingual experience for our now 5 year old son, SPL, Mandarin was an obvious candidate: it’s extremely relevant to today’s world. That was the idea. Figuring out how to give him a high quality dual language experience has been an extremely challenging enterprise. We were fortunate to have friends who walked this road before us, and they were able to point us to an extremely competent early childhood caregiver who was able to start with SPL when he was 3; at 5 he’s quite proficient in both Mandarin and English. So we were lucky as a starting point.</p>\n<p>We’ve spent much of the last year trying to figure out the best way to continue Sam’s Mandarin into more formal schooling as he enters kindergarten, and it’s a real challenge. There are, of course, several private options – but only 1 of them on the whole Peninsula had a strong constructivist approach, but the Mandarin is not immersion, and that school is, in any event, very much in the formative stages. And there’s CLIP in Cupertino, as a public school option, but we believe it’s a significantly more traditional Chinese approach to education than we’d like.</p>\n<p>Which leaves Ohlone. It’s a public school with an incredibly strong history. It’s got a focus on the whole child, including supporting discovery for each child. And the Mandarin program is immersive. That combination of characteristics, in our experience, makes Ohlone unique. That’s not something we say lightly, but we haven’t found any significant blending of progressive teaching techniques and strong Mandarin instruction in any context, let alone in a public institution. It seems to us a wonderful option for our own son, and one that’s sorely needed in an increasingly multi-cultural Bay Area and nation. And it seems to us that it’s an incredible example of modern, ambitious education that works, and can help others around the country follow.</p>\n<p>For all those reasons and more we strongly encourage you to support giving the program a more permanent status at Ohlone and PAUSD. Thanks for your consideration and efforts so far – the program’s been incredibly inspirational to us as we find our own way.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Kathy Howe &amp; John Lilly</p><br>\n",

It reminded me of listening to some of that music growing up, but the other reason that I liked it (other than that the music was exceedingly beautiful) is that it&rsquo;s in such contrast to the hyper-paced, global, 24/7, always connected, media slammed life that we all live today. It allowed me to pause a bit, to reflect on what it means to be devoted to a cause, to spend your life trying to express ideas (in music or otherwise), and to think about things larger than just what products are released today that we can buy each other for Christmas. I doubt that I&rsquo;ll ever be a particularly religious person again in my life, but I felt very lucky to be able to attend Evensong and think some about perspective and pacing and commitment.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it was an incredible trip &ndash; Sherry and Reid did a masterful job in putting it all together &ndash; it was a little overwhelming, to be honest.

It reminded me of listening to some of that music growing up, but the other reason that I liked it (other than that the music was exceedingly beautiful) is that it's in such contrast to the hyper-paced, global, 24/7, always connected, media slammed life that we all live today. It allowed me to pause a bit, to reflect on what it means to be devoted to a cause, to spend your life trying to express ideas (in music or otherwise), and to think about things larger than just what products are released today that we can buy each other for Christmas. I doubt that I'll ever be a particularly religious person again in my life, but I felt very lucky to be able to attend Evensong and think some about perspective and pacing and commitment.\n\nAnyway, it was an incredible trip -- Sherry and Reid did a masterful job in putting it all together -- it was a little overwhelming, to be honest. There are some great things happening in London and Cambridge, and I can't wait to see where they go.\n",

This book was an incredible insight then, in 1994, ten years after it was written, and I have to say that in 2010, it reads like a completely current account of what's happening in our public lives today. (Owing to the time, it focuses on how television changes our culture; obviously you have to replace that with the Web, but it is <i>amazingly</i> modern in its insight.)</p>\n<p>It's got to be one of the 5 most influential books that I've ever read, and it's getting better and better with age. As such, I'm going to quote here at some length, but if you haven't read it, you should go get it, and read at least the beginning and end, as soon as you can.</p>\n<p>Here's the basic premise of the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><span class=\"highlight\">We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn’t, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares. But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell’s dark vision, there was another—slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think. What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on</span> the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us. This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is my intention in this book to show that a great media-metaphor shift has taken place in America, with the result that the content of much of our public discourse has become dangerous nonsense. With this in view, my task in the chapters ahead is straightforward. I must, first, demonstrate how, under the governance of the printing press, discourse in America was different from what it is now—generally coherent, serious and rational; and then how, under the governance of television, it has become shriveled and absurd. But to avoid the possibility that my analysis will be interpreted as standard-brand academic whimpering, a kind of elitist complaint against “junk” on television, I must first explain that my focus is on epistemology, not on aesthetics or literary criticism. Indeed, I appreciate junk as much as the next fellow, and I know full well that the printing press has generated enough of it to fill the Grand Canyon to overflowing. Television is not old enough to have matched printing’s output of junk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And this, the most important point: \"My argument is limited to saying that a major new medium changes the structure of discourse; it does so by encouraging certain uses of the intellect, by favoring certain definitions of intelligence and wisdom, and by demanding a certain kind of content—in a phrase, by creating new forms of truth-telling.\"</p>\n<p>And this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><span class=\"highlight\">The telegraph introduced a kind of public conversation whose form had startling characteristics: Its language was the language of</span> headlines—sensational, fragmented, impersonal. News took the form of slogans, to be noted with excitement, to be forgotten with dispatch. Its language was also entirely discontinuous. One message had no connection to that which preceded or followed it. Each “headline” stood alone as its own context. The receiver of the news had to provide a meaning if he could. The sender was under no obligation to do so. And because of all this, the world as depicted by the telegraph began to appear unmanageable, even undecipherable. The line-by-line, sequential, continuous form of the printed page slowly began to lose its resonance as a metaphor of how knowledge was to be acquired and how the world was to be understood. “Knowing” the facts took on a new meaning, for it did not imply that one understood implications, background, or connections. Telegraphic discourse permitted no time for historical perspectives and gave no priority to the qualitative. To the telegraph, intelligence meant knowing of lots of things, not knowing about them.<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the last thing I'll leave you with is this short idea: \"...what I am claiming here is not that television is entertaining but that it has made entertainment itself the natural format for the representation of all experience.\"</p>This is a beautiful, beautiful book. I really hope more people will read it and internalize what's happening to our culture and discourse.\n\n<p>Of course, it'll make a crappy movie, so maybe I'm hoping for too much.</p>\n",

With an introduction by Tim O'Reilly, it's a look at how open source ideas and architectures are influencing our democracy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thankfully, the lessons of the Internet—open standards, open-source software, and data-driven applications—are all being followed, albeit with greater or lesser focus in one project or another. (That’s true in the private sector as well.) Open APIs are being developed that will allow applications to work across the country (and eventually, internationally), rather than being bound to the systems of any one city. Projects like Code for America are working to build mechanisms for sharing code, expertise, and best practices between cities. We’re seeing new alliances between governments at the federal, state, and local levels to increase citizen services, eliminate redundancy, and reduce costs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\">But it's not all happy -- he also talks about how the main focus has been on transparency and sunlight, but that that's not nearly enough -- we need to build better architectures of participation.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yet rather than learning from its early mistakes and trying to provide for more meaningful and structured forms of public participation, the White House has since neglected the “participation” plank of the Open Government Initiative, shifting almost all of its focus to the safer realm of open data and government transparency. As the New Democrat Network has noted, the Open Government Directive “does a lot for the ‘Transparency’ part … but not much for the ‘Participation’ or ‘Collaboration’ portions … To really get the full benefit of the wisdom of the crowd, the government’s next step will have to ensure the dialogue is truly two-way.”14 Indeed, the danger that comes with focusing almost exclusively on transparency—a vital yet insufficient goal—is that we may end up seeing the failures of our government but being left with little recourse for doing anything about them. Transparency without avenues for real participation seems a bit like watching a police interrogation from behind a two-way mirror. While you can see what is going on, you have little ability to do anything if something goes wrong. And in any case, transparency has run aground as well. Abandoning his pledge to do health care around a table on C-SPAN, the president consented to a process of congressional wheeling, dealing, and capitulation to special interests, personified most by senators like Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman. Once the House and the Senate finally passed their divergent bills, the White House—in a rush to sign a bill—gave its blessing to skipping the conference-committee process and conducting negotiations to reconcile the two bills in private, among Democrats alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, I think this book is required reading for those who hope to change our government.</p><br>\n",

But here, in the heart of British government, it&rsquo;s impossible for me not to think about a couple of British authors and imaginers of future dystopias: George Orwell and Aldous Huxley.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>With these 2 especially, it seems a particular talent of the British to imagine horrible dysfunctional futures. Orwell in his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1984,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of course, with nightmares of totalitarian control and surveillance, and oppressive government imposed on unwilling citizens. Huxley, by contrast, in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brave New World,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> painted a completely different picture: a citizenry of sheep happily gorging themselves on the trivial, on entertainment &ndash; with no Orwellian Ministry of Information needed at all.</p>\n<p>In a book called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amusing Ourselves to Death<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an American named Neil Postman figured out nearly 30 years ago that what we were going to get wasn&rsquo;t Orwell&rsquo;s world at all, but rather a version of Huxley&rsquo;s. And while the British seem to be adept at imagining dystopias, I have to say that we Americans seem to be pretty handy at creating them. In the US now, we clearly live in Huxley&rsquo;s world: news has become entertainment; political discourse, when not an oxymoron, tends to be shallow. So many of the institutions and processes that have served us well for hundreds of years are breaking down.</p>\n<p>Much of this is due to the nature of digital technology and the Internet, allowing massive amounts of new conversation, of news without context. The thing that digital technology is best at is closing gaps: in time, in space, in relevance &ndash; and that has put real stress on our institutions. Technology is not neutral &ndash; it makes many things easier, but also many things more difficult. There are winners and losers.</p>\n<p>Clay Shirky, writing on the massive dislocations occurring today in the newspaper industry wrote: &ldquo;That is what real revolutions are like. The old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in place.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And things do feel broken today, in many ways &ndash; the forces of dystopia seem to be on the rise.\nBut even so, there is a lot &ndash; A LOT &ndash; to be optimistic about. The hints of a positive future show all around us. The seeds of utopia are in the ground, so to speak.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>What we know from the work we&rsquo;ve done at Mozilla on Firefox and other open source projects, is that the way we organize, the technology we use, and the customs we support &ndash; what Tim O&rsquo;Reilly has called &ldquo;architectures of participation&rdquo; &ndash; matter greatly. Architectures of participation, like technologies themselves, aren&rsquo;t neutral. Projects like Wikipedia and Mozilla Firefox have architectures that are designed to bring in collaborators from everywhere, at every level. We have very serious contributors who spend most of their time working on the core. We have nearly 100 teams working on localizing Firefox into their own language. We have entrepreneurs building companies based on extensions to the browser. We have tens of thousands of people who test our browser each night and report issues. And we have hundreds of millions of users.

				"content_text": "<span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:medium;\">I'm currently in the middle of an extremely interesting trip called Silicon Valley Comes to the UK, which Sherri Coutou and Reid Hoffman have organized for several years. it's a fantastic trip so far, and I'll write more about it, but wanted to share this.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Yesterday we were invited to the House of Commons here in London, and after a short speech by the Speaker of the House of Commons, 5 of us participated in a panel on the impact of digital technology on the future of democracies. About 100 people attended, including several MPs and members of the House of Lords, plus people involved in running the government and figuring out what to do with technology.</span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">It was moderated by Jon Drori (fantastic job, and fantastic guy), and the Silicon Valley folks who participated were: Reid Hoffman, Megan Smith, Joi Ito, Nancy Lublin and myself. Each of the 5 of us started by giving a 5 minute 'provocation' to consider, then we ran it as a more traditional panel.</span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I'll write more soon; for now, my provocation follows. Would love to hear what you think. :-)</span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">---</span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:medium;\">As I started preparing my remarks, I knew that I wanted to talk, in the main, about how technology can make our democracies better. But here, in the heart of British government, it's impossible for me not to think about a couple of British authors and imaginers of future dystopias: George Orwell and Aldous Huxley.</span>\n\nWith these 2 especially, it seems a particular talent of the British to imagine horrible dysfunctional futures. Orwell in his <em>1984,</em> of course, with nightmares of totalitarian control and surveillance, and oppressive government imposed on unwilling citizens. Huxley, by contrast, in <em>Brave New World,</em> painted a completely different picture: a citizenry of sheep happily gorging themselves on the trivial, on entertainment -- with no Orwellian Ministry of Information needed at all.\n\nIn a book called <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death</em>, an American named Neil Postman figured out nearly 30 years ago that what we were going to get wasn't Orwell's world at all, but rather a version of Huxley's. And while the British seem to be adept at imagining dystopias, I have to say that we Americans seem to be pretty handy at creating them. In the US now, we clearly live in Huxley's world: news has become entertainment; political discourse, when not an oxymoron, tends to be shallow. So many of the institutions and processes that have served us well for hundreds of years are breaking down.\n\nMuch of this is due to the nature of digital technology and the Internet, allowing massive amounts of new conversation, of news without context. The thing that digital technology is best at is closing gaps: in time, in space, in relevance -- and that has put real stress on our institutions. Technology is not neutral -- it makes many things easier, but also many things more difficult. There are winners and losers.\n\nClay Shirky, writing on the massive dislocations occurring today in the newspaper industry wrote: \"That is what real revolutions are like. The old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in place.\"\n\nAnd things do feel broken today, in many ways -- the forces of dystopia seem to be on the rise.\nBut even so, there is a lot -- A LOT -- to be optimistic about. The hints of a positive future show all around us. The seeds of utopia are in the ground, so to speak.\n<ul>\n\t<li> Take <a href=\"http://www.fixmystreet.com\">FixMyStreet</a>, here in the UK -- collective intelligence to help find and fix problems.</li>\n\t<li> And <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com\">Ushahidi</a>, which started in Kenya but has become global.</li>\n\t<li> And <a href=\"http://www.crisiscommons.org\">CrisisCommons.org</a> to coordinate responses to crises around the globe.</li>\n\t<li> And the <a href=\"http://www.sunlightfoundation.com\">Sunlight Foundation</a>, which resulted in support for <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org\">OpenCongress.org</a> among many others.</li>\n\t<li> And even the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment/\">directive to all US agencies to break down barriers to transparency</a>, participation and collaboration, which President Obama signed on his very first day in office.</li>\n</ul>\nSo clearly there are real opportunities here, shaped by the natural affordances of Internet and digital technology.\n\nWhat we know from the work we've done at Mozilla on Firefox and other open source projects, is that the way we organize, the technology we use, and the customs we support -- what Tim O'Reilly has called \"architectures of participation\" -- matter greatly. Architectures of participation, like technologies themselves, aren't neutral. Projects like Wikipedia and Mozilla Firefox have architectures that are designed to bring in collaborators from everywhere, at every level. We have very serious contributors who spend most of their time working on the core. We have nearly 100 teams working on localizing Firefox into their own language. We have entrepreneurs building companies based on extensions to the browser. We have tens of thousands of people who test our browser each night and report issues. And we have hundreds of millions of users. We've built architectures of participation to get people engaged in as many ways as we can.\n\nSo what's the future utopia that's possible with digital technology? Ideally what we get -- what we create -- is a system where citizens are engaged, where they feel valued and connected with their governments and each other. Where our leaders are accountable -- and desire to be accountable. It's a future where it's just as easy to help your neighborhood as it is to help your country or your planet.\nTo get there, we'll need to architect with a few key principles in mind:\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Transparency</strong> - where most of today's efforts are, and critical to how we start</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Clarity</strong> - flip side of scale - not the same as transparency -- often, transparency of information can overwhelm -- without a narrative, without intent, it's very difficult to understand the implications of the transparency itself</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Engagement</strong> - get everyone more educated and informed and contributing - get subject experts involved</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Scale</strong> - must consider neighborhood government to municipal to national to transnational</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Heterogeneity</strong> - life is increasingly cross-border, in all senses - trans-national - trans-company - mixture of public and private life</li>\n</ol>\nSo my provocation turns out to be more of an exhortation, a call to action. As technologists and entrepreneurs and leaders of government, it's our opportunity -- and our responsibility -- to imagine and articulate good, positive architectures of government, to engage with our colleagues and neighbors and coworkers and constituents to envision robust models for the future, in the context of ubiquitous, cheap, immediate information technology -- and then to get on with making the world the way we want it.\n",

				"title": "Sharded Year",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I've had this post rolling around in my head for some months now, but until a couple of weeks ago didn't really know how to frame it up. The gist of it is this: it's been a really complex, dynamic, shifting, difficult, but in many ways gratifying year. (Since about January, give or take but probably a month or two before that.)</p>\n<p>But a friend the other day told me he's feeling like his life lately is a collection of shards -- lots of different, distinct activities -- so many that they're all-consuming -- but because they're so different, they don't quite add up to a whole like he's used to things. (He's an <i>extraordinarily</i> high performing &amp; functioning guy, so even in this \"sharded\" state, he's getting a humbling amount of important work done.)</p>\n<p>That captures how I feel about my year in a lot of ways. The start of things was right around Christmas last year when Mom had some serious health issues (she's fine now; doing fantastically well). The year has been complicated with work, of course, as I transition out of Mozilla and to Greylock. Dislocating my shoulder and the subsequent surgery and (ongoing rehab) changed the whole complexion of the year for me -- it's hard to explain how significant it's been. And my grandmother died in August, having lived a full life and going out on her own terms, but nevertheless, a major transition.</p>\n<p>Add to that watching and helping and learning as SPL turned 5 and continues to grow into being his own person. And the day-to-day successes and failures in the role of husband and father -- on the whole doing very positively, but living an imperfect life, as we all do.</p>\n<p>So when my friend talked about his \"collection of shards\" for the year, I really understood what he meant. On the whole, I'm feeling as happy now as I've felt in some time, and am feeling great about the coming months and years. But I'd like a little more coherence and resonance across activities than I've had this year.</p>\n<p>When I talk with friends, I find that others have felt a bit like this in 2010 and 2009 -- so many of them that it seems to me that the context of the state of the world and our country must be playing some part.</p>\n<p>But here's the really good news, at least for me: I've felt this way before. And, in fact, I find that I tend to have periods of stability that last many years, with periodic shardings. 1995 was a year like that for me: leaving Stanford, starting Trilogy, parents divorcing, grandfather dying, reconnecting with Kathy, moving to Austin -- lots of motion, many shards. So was 2005: Sam was born, joined Mozilla, left the company I started. And in every case (those plus some others), what was happening in retrospect was that I was rearranging the furniture of my life, reconfiguring things for something new, and the steep learning curves associated with the sharded year over time yielded to a better understanding of myself and my family and my work, and a new sense of where I fit and how to be who I wanted to be.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure this will sound super coherent to anyone but me, but wanted to capture how I'm feeling, and why even with so much in motion (and I'm adding a few new shards as we speak), I'm feeling very comfortable and happy about today, and tomorrow, and the days after that.</p>\n",

So I picked up the first volume and really, really loved it. It's a sort of <i>T<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Running-Man-Stephen-King/dp/0451197968\">he Running Man</a></i> but for kids, with pretty overt political themes, strong game play elements, and very quickly paced. Loved it. The second book, <i>Catching Fire,</i> I also read over a couple of days, and was lucky in my timing that the day I finished it, the third volume in the series came out. The first book was stronger than the other two, I thought, but the whole series is entertaining and well done, and won't take you long to read, anyway. (And <i>much</i> preferable to Percy Jackson, in my estimation.)</p>\n",

He's the Chair of Sociology at NYU, and is an incredibly sharp thinker.</p>\n<p>As the subtitle (\"How We Got from the Company Man, Family Dinners, and the Affluent Society to the Home Office, Blackberry Moms, and Economic Anxiety\") suggests, it's a collection of essays on how America has changed -- how the lowering of the cost of subsistence goods, the rise of women in the workforce, and the growing influence of technology in our lives has completely transformed our class system and our relationships to others and ourselves.</p>\n<p>There are some complex topics here, and Dalton is a way better writer on this than I'll ever be, so I'll just leave you with a selection of his ideas that struck me. They're all in different parts of the book, and are pretty complicated in how he talks about them, and the excerpts are a little long, but see what you think. :-)</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><span class=\"highlight\">\"Something is new here. Ever-striving Americans in a land of immigrant dreams and Horatio Alger myths is nothing remarkable on this continent. What is novel is that Americans used to work themselves to the bone for material necessities and to rise up out of constant struggle so their children wouldn’t have to. Leisure was something you attained when you reached a certain income level. Today, a different dynamic has taken shape: For the first time in history, the more we are paid, the more hours we work. Paradoxically, perhaps, we do this now because among the luckiest of us the rewards for working are so great, they make the “opportunity cost” of not working all the greater. The result is that we no longer have leisure-class elites. The rich are working harder than ever. (Even those born to great wealth now feel the pressure to work for work’s sake.) Rather, leisure is something for the poor. This seemingly arcane economic measure—the income elasticity of leisure—represents a fundamental change in how many of us live; and, obviously, this change has affected not just when we work, but also how we play, how we love, how we raise our children—how we live.\"</span><br></p>\n\n  <p><span class=\"highlight\">\"</span>That’s why Mr. Elsewhere is constantly having “meetings” that are ambiguous in nature. Part of each workday is spent drinking lattes with folks who may be potential clients, or investors, or just interesting people from whom the newest hot idea for private equity may arise. Since one never knows where the next next big thing is lurking, any meeting could result in the opportunity of a lifetime for the artist, movie producer, venture capitalist, salesperson, or business consultant. It could be the woman he meets on the plane who runs an environmental nonprofit that badly needs a Web redesign. It could be the father of his child’s playmate in the sandbox who runs a hedge fund on his BlackBerry while changing dirty diapers. Or it could even be the kid herself, who has just the look Mrs. 2009 needs for her newest marketing campaign. Even when the Elsewhere class ostensibly go out purely to socialize, they find that they cannot stop themselves from glancing at their text messages, talking work, or making valuable introductions across the table. It all may be a Ponzi scheme, but it certainly is no shell game: In an information and service economy, much of what drives success is, in fact, social skills.\"</p>\n\n  <p>\"The essential character of positional goods in our time is that the satisfaction they provide is not intrinsic to their value to an individual—i.e., their ability to satisfy hunger, thirst, or even to express ourselves. Rather, their utility relies almost entirely on their relative social position....One consequence is the increasing role that material goods play as positional goods—something Hirsch didn’t consider. Mrs. and Mr. Elsewhere absolutely have to have the latest iPhone, McMansion, or SUV. There’s nothing inherent about an iPhone that makes it a positional good. Some (but not all) of its features are material improvements on previous models. It may save us time and effort to have all of our music, phone numbers, and photos in one handy little gadget. Or it may not, as some users are finding. However, to the extent that the pleasure from the iPhone or the Hummer or the $5,000 gas grill (a favorite example of the economist Robert Frank in his related book, Luxury Fever) stems from the fact that it is better—or at least more costly and thus rarer—than the grills of one’s neighbors, it has become a status or positional good. It is through this magical endowment of material objects with the powers of relative position that we think we have solved the problems inherent in mass consumption of positional goods—if only fleetingly. Never mind the credit card bill that is to come: For now, the magical object has done its job, and we are satisfied (if not quite happy, since the actuality of the thing may be disappointing compared to the idea of owning it in the abstract). So, when people talk about the dematerialization of the economy, what they should be really calling it is a de-necessitation of the economy, as in a deemphasis on basic, physical necessities; or, alternatively, a luxurification or positionification.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\">I've also got a book on my shelf that he wrote about birth order in families called <i>The Pecking Order</i> that I'm looking forward to reading.</span></p>\n",

They wrote music about things that mostly misfit males of my generation cared about. They struggled through Ayn Rand, wrote music about The Lord of the Rings, about science fiction. They worked through a lot of what then seemed like important existential questions, but now seem a little embarrassing to have struggled through in the first place. But in the middle 80s mostly what they wrote about was what it felt like being out of the mainstream &ndash; really, they sang about what it meant to be a nerd, and the things that nerds went through as they figured out how to become functioning parts of society.</p>\n<p>I always felt like they were writing for me and people like me, and it really struck a chord. I loved the music, too &ndash; they wrote some of the most complex music of the times (ever?), with lots of moving time signatures, lots of unusual arrangements where the bass led, things like that. A lot of people have always been critical of the band for being a little too perfect, a little too soulless &ndash; in pursuit of technical perfection rather than connecting at an emotional level.

				"content_text": "<img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Starman\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/02/Starman.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"230\">\n\nAs followers of my tweets know, I was really excited to see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_%28band%29\">Rush</a> in concert this week at Shoreline. Naturally, since the band is over 30 years old now, a bunch of people around work had no idea who they are. (And I got a bunch of questions like \"You're going to see Rush Limbaugh?? Why??\")\n\nAnyway, the truth is, Rush is about my favorite band ever, and I could listen to them pretty much all day long, every day. They're the only band I can listen to and sing along to, <em>while reading a book about something completely different. </em>The lyrics of their twenty-odd albums are that deep in my brain.\n\nI think we all tend to be musical products of the years we were in high school, and more than any other bands, Rush and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M.\">R.E.M.</a> were the definitive ones for me. R.E.M., of course, were the guys you wanted to be as cool as -- they were hip, were talking about things that didn't really make sense to a teenager (or R.E.M. themselves, apparently, as Stipe later said he mostly made up the words because they sounded good).\n\nRush was different, though. They wrote music about things that mostly misfit males of my generation cared about. They struggled through Ayn Rand, wrote music about The Lord of the Rings, about science fiction. They worked through a lot of what then seemed like important existential questions, but now seem a little embarrassing to have struggled through in the first place. But in the middle 80s mostly what they wrote about was what it felt like being out of the mainstream -- really, they sang about what it meant to be a nerd, and the things that nerds went through as they figured out how to become functioning parts of society.\n\nI always felt like they were writing for me and people like me, and it really struck a chord. I loved the music, too -- they wrote some of the most complex music of the times (ever?), with lots of moving time signatures, lots of unusual arrangements where the bass led, things like that. A lot of people have always been critical of the band for being a little too perfect, a little too soulless -- in pursuit of technical perfection rather than connecting at an emotional level. (To make this article even nerdier than it already is (!), the claim is that they're sort of the rock band equivalent of the font Helvetica -- a little too perfect to have much character.)\n\nBut I never felt like that. I just loved the music, loved the lyrics, and as uncool as it is now to like a prog rock back, I <em>still </em>really love listening to them. (Other bands of the era like Yes haven't held up nearly as well for me.)\n\nWatching the recent documentary on them (<a href=\"http://www.rushbeyondthelightedstage.com/\">Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage</a> -- highly recommended) was a bit of a revelation for me -- it tells the story of these 3 guys from Toronto (Alex &amp; Geddy &amp; John Rutsey, with Neil coming along after the first album) who were nerds themselves growing up, who never really fit in either.

It starts by talking about salmon farming, something that humans have been doing for something more than 500 years -- I had no idea. Goes into pretty good detail about the relative merits of wild salmon fishing versus farmed salmon harvesting -- although it doesn't really make it clear at all what to buy at Whole Foods.</p>\n<p>He makes it clear that sea bass -- or, more generally, perciforms -- despite their relative ubiquity, are a pretty strange choice in fish to domesticate -- very tricky. (Also, there are a <i>lot</i> of different fish that we call sea bass, but they're all pretty different.)</p>\n<p>Cod, of course, was well chronicled by Mark Kurlansky in his outstanding book <i>Cod,</i> about 10 years ago -- and Greenburg does a good job of taking that work as a baseline and extending it in the context of sustainable oceans now, and what's happened in the Grand Banks over the past decade or so.</p>\n<p>And it's a bit of an ode to tuna, especially the dwindling bluefin tuna, which he asserts is one of the most incredible fish species and that we need to stop fishing now.</p>\n<p>Anyway, great book, and with real suggestions for sustainability at the end. (In short, pick fish more suitable for farming: tra, tilapia, and the Kona kampachi.)</p>\n<p>My mom reminded me the other day that I have sometimes, um, esoteric tastes in what I read -- and I guess that's true. But I really liked this book, and think it's relatively rare for books to change the way you think about your relationship with the world. Very recommended.</p>\n<p>And with sentences like this:</p>\n<p>\"<span class=\"highlight\">The hoki is a gadiform descended from a fish that ended up in the Southern Hemisphere after the great gadiform radiation tens of millions of years ago.\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\">How can you not want to read more? :-)</span></p>\n\n  <div style=\"margin:0;padding:0;\"></div>\n",

I read all 5 books, in order, but didn't really like them very much. They're sort of like a cross between Harry Potter and Greek mythology, but with all the action, including Mt. Olympus, centered around present day Manhattan.</p>\n<p>What could go wrong, really?</p>\n<p>Yeah, everything you just imagined as an answer to that last question is pretty much true. This really isn't a very good series of books. I <i>totally</i> understand why my nephew liked them -- they're basically fun books with a teenager in control, with some tortured Greek mythology thrown in the mix.</p>\n<p>Anyway, since I read all 5 books, they're obviously not <i>horrible,</i> but they weren't really what I was hoping for. The mythology is pretty dubious, but it did cause me to run down the rabbit hole on Wikipedia a few times to learn about various Titans and minor gods, so that's not <i>all</i> bad.</p>\n",

She died in a hospital near where she lived on St. Simon&rsquo;s Island in Georgia, following an accident she had last weekend.</p>\n<p>She was my mother&rsquo;s mother, and I never knew her as May, really, but rather &ldquo;Gigi,&rdquo; a name she gave herself when I was born.

She moved to two dollars in the eighties, when I was in my teens and able to spend with more velocity. Those cards continued into college for me, and even after. In 1997, after I&rsquo;d been working at Trilogy and then Apple, we saw each other at my Mom&rsquo;s graduation ceremony (for her Masters in Library Science) and I remember proudly giving Gigi one of my Apple business cards. Without missing a beat, she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sending $2 to a Senior Scientist at Apple??&rdquo; Pretty funny. She was always super quick and super sharp with her humor &ndash; so that, at least, I come by honestly. She&rsquo;s been sending SPL cards with a couple of dollars in them since he was born. A nice tradition and connection to her that always made me smile.</p>\n<p>But the thing that I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> remember about her is all the books. She owned a bookstore on St. Simons called The Shorebird, and one of my favorite things to do was to go to work with her. I would sit in the back and read everything back there, for what seemed like hours (but probably wasn&rsquo;t) and remember feeling like I was a very lucky kid - and, of course, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about her a bunch the last few days, naturally, but especially because we&rsquo;ve been at Disneyland, for SPL&rsquo;s first visit there. One of my earliest memories is going to Walt Disney World with Gigi and the rest of the family (since they lived pretty close to Orlando), and it brings a lot of things full circle for me to be here now. More on that in a bit.</p>\n<p>She leaves behind such a good family &ndash; my mom and her two brothers, who have been wonderful uncles (and now great uncles), and the seven grandkids (my cousins, my brother, and me), who are such a smart, funny, diverse, and talented group. No small feat.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Gigi lived a good life, and I&rsquo;ll miss her a lot.</p>\n<p>R.I.P., May Pearce Korb, 1923 - 2010</p>\n",

Thus G.G. for \"Grundoon's Grandmother.\" I've never really known what to make of that story (although, in retrospect, not really all that flattering) but she's always just been Gigi to me.\n\nA couple of little glimpses into my memories of her:\n\nWhen I was growing up, she always used to send cards for about every holiday -- birthday, Christmas, Easter, Halloween, whatever - and they always had a dollar bill in them. She moved to two dollars in the eighties, when I was in my teens and able to spend with more velocity. Those cards continued into college for me, and even after. In 1997, after I'd been working at Trilogy and then Apple, we saw each other at my Mom's graduation ceremony (for her Masters in Library Science) and I remember proudly giving Gigi one of my Apple business cards. Without missing a beat, she said, \"I've been sending $2 to a Senior Scientist at Apple??\" Pretty funny. She was always super quick and super sharp with her humor -- so that, at least, I come by honestly. She's been sending SPL cards with a couple of dollars in them since he was born. A nice tradition and connection to her that always made me smile.\n\nBut the thing that I <i>really</i> remember about her is all the books. She owned a bookstore on St. Simons called The Shorebird, and one of my favorite things to do was to go to work with her. I would sit in the back and read everything back there, for what seemed like hours (but probably wasn't) and remember feeling like I was a very lucky kid - and, of course, that's exactly right.\n\nI've been thinking about her a bunch the last few days, naturally, but especially because we've been at Disneyland, for SPL's first visit there. One of my earliest memories is going to Walt Disney World with Gigi and the rest of the family (since they lived pretty close to Orlando), and it brings a lot of things full circle for me to be here now. More on that in a bit.\n\nShe leaves behind such a good family -- my mom and her two brothers, who have been wonderful uncles (and now great uncles), and the seven grandkids (my cousins, my brother, and me), who are such a smart, funny, diverse, and talented group. No small feat.\n\nAnyway, Gigi lived a good life, and I'll miss her a lot.\n\nR.I.P., May Pearce Korb, 1923 - 2010\n",

Foer is one of the most talented novelists that I've read in the past decade, and he's a very compelling writer. This book is a bit of why he's become vegan himself, as well as an attack on industrial ranching and meat production, not to mention an illustration of the many ways we're cruel to the animals that we eventually eat.</p>\n<p>I'm not a vegetarian (or vegan) myself, although I'm trending that way. It used to be that I'd have meat for every meal -- now as a family, we tend to eat vegetarian at home at least half the time. (We probably eat salmon 30% of the rest of the time, and chicken the remainder.) We've been looking for more recipes that use garbanzo beans and black beans -- found some good ones, especially Indian dishes.</p>\n<p>In any case, intellectually, I'm pretty sympathetic to Foer's arguments here, and wholly in agreement that industrial ranching is a very bad development. In practice, I still eat meat that's produced like that. I tend to think we'd be healthier with more vegetables compared to meat, it would be more sustainable globally, and would be overall ethical. I'm not quite the guy I want to be in this regard yet, but this was a good book to remind me about how I'd like to be.</p>\n",

I've always found him to be smart, encouraging, engaging, and interesting to talk with about work and management, and find that, more than most people in the field, he's extremely data-driven in his work. I also find that he's got an incredible ethical framework, and is very wise about the art of management.</p>\n<p>He's got a new book coming in September, and I really, really like it -- I think it's his most profound and useful work to date. I'm generally not a fan of business books -- I find that usually their main value is in the title (and if it's really awesome, maybe the introduction is useful) -- but this one, which I've read a pre-pub copy of, is great.</p>\n<p>His last book, <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Rule-Civilized-Workplace-Surviving/dp/0446526568/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b\">The No Asshole Rule</a>,</i> got a lot of attention, partly for the provocative title, but really more for the ideas on how much culture matters in productive workplaces. And it clearly struck a nerve with people suffering from bad or incompetent managers. His new book is a little less situated in the negative context associated with bad managers, and talks more about how to be an exceptional leader. That distinction is important -- it's obviously easy to be a bad manager, and hard to be a good one -- but it's another thing entirely to be a really exceptional leader, and Bob has gone to great lengths in this book to look at some of the world's best leaders and really understand what sets them apart.</p>\n<p>You can get a taste of the book in this Harvard Business Review post by Bob titled <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2010/05/12_things_that_good_bosses_bel.html\">\"12 Things Good Bosses Believe\"</a> -- this is an extremely powerful list of things that the best managers believe.</p>\n<p>I fall short of these ideals a lot -- I imagine everyone does, really -- but every single one of them is worth thinking about and striving for each and every day in the workplace. This book is a great one because it reminds me of how good great leaders can be, and I really recommend you pick it up when it comes out.</p>\n",

It&rsquo;s a little rambly.</p>\n<p>I know that I&rsquo;m writing and tweeting a lot about all of this lately &ndash; to be honest, it occupies a huge part of my brain &ndash; it&rsquo;s a big deal for me this year. I was talking with someone over the weekend who said he&rsquo;d had a similar surgery last year, and that it completely changed the complexion of his year. I&rsquo;m finding the same thing &ndash; it dominates my mood and thinking &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s how the shoulder hurts, the psychology of maneuvering with the sling, whatever.</p>\n<p>Other than just being on my mind a lot, I&rsquo;m writing so much for a couple of other reasons. First, as a reminder to myself over the years of the specifics of the injury and recovery. Second, because as I progress through this, I&rsquo;m finding relevant information about what everything feels like to be tough to find on the web, and I hope that it can help others who are going through it.</p>\n<p>My last post was a couple of weeks after the surgery, and we&rsquo;re now a couple of weeks past that &ndash; I saw the surgeon Tuesday and things looked good enough to stop wearing the sling and start physical therapy. I&rsquo;m <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->happy not to wear the sling anymore. The physical aspects were annoying, but it was really the psychological aspects that I was getting tired of &ndash; being in a sling for weeks, I found that I started to think of myself as less vital, more gimpy. I knew it wasn&rsquo;t really true, and it was just temporary, but it wore on me a lot in any case.</p>\n<p>Overall, things are going well &ndash; it&rsquo;s been pretty painful overall &ndash; and lately my shoulder hurts most of the time (although it goes up and down). Sleeping has consistently been the biggest problem. Was hard to sleep with the sling, is hard to sleep with the soreness and sharp pains when I move in the wrong way. But making it through.</p>\n<p>Wednesday I started physical therapy &ndash; I&rsquo;ve got 2 weeks of passive stretching &amp; range of motion exercises (I move the arm with my other arm, or the physical therapist moves it) and then another couple of weeks of active range of motion (where I use the arm itself). After that, 4 weeks of resistance training rehab, and who knows after that. So now I&rsquo;m about 5 days into it. The exercises aren&rsquo;t complicated &ndash; it&rsquo;s about 30 minutes of laying with my arms wide, stretching them on an exercise ball, doing pendulums, etc. They&rsquo;re designed to stretch out the capsule that holds the shoulder. The point of the surgery is to tighten up the capsule &ndash; and they overtighten it in surgery and use PT to loosen it to a manageable level.</p>\n<p>The most interesting/freaky aspect of this phase is psychological, too &ndash; the therapist on Wednesday moved my shoulder into positions that my brain <!-- raw HTML omitted -->knows <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will dislocate &ndash; or rather would have dislocated before the repair. So when I start to approach those positions, I&rsquo;m finding myself tense up and fight against the motion, which makes everything hurt more. I find it&rsquo;s also triggering a strong fear response &ndash; just a very strong aversion to letting my arm get moved around, some feeling of nausea, etc. The next day, the first one where I was doing the exercises by myself with nobody to ask questions of, was actually a little scarier to me, just because it was a completely unknown feeling.</p>\n<p>The good news is that, as of today, Day 5, things are going really well. The difference between today and last week is astonishing, and I&rsquo;m finding that every day my range of motion is a little bit bigger, and the fear &amp; nausea responses are becoming less severe and happening less often. It hurts most of the time &ndash; there&rsquo;s not really any time that goes by that I&rsquo;m not aware of it and devoting some attention to it. But it feels pretty good in the mornings now, and hurts more through the day as it gets more tired.</p>\n<p>I find, too, that I&rsquo;m trying to be as aggressive as I can about it &ndash; doing the exercises a couple of times a day instead of just once (I asked whether that would be okay) &ndash; so hopefully that&rsquo;s helping. I know I can&rsquo;t accelerate it that much &ndash; I think a lot of it is just diligence and time to heal.</p>\n<p>The most amazing thing so far is that I can&rsquo;t remember, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at all, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what the surgery and rehab was like when I first repaired the shoulder, in a much more invasive open procedure, in 1990. I literally can&rsquo;t remember going to a physical therapist, can&rsquo;t figure out when I got better, since I didn&rsquo;t take any time off from school, and can only vaguely remember being in the hospital (it was a 3 day thing instead of just the morning like this year). I can remember a lot about both years at Stanford before and after it, but really nothing about getting my shoulder better. Weird.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this note is a little all over the place, which is a little how I feel, too. :-) But I&rsquo;m happy to be more active now, and optimistic that the rehab is going well and starting to convince myself that my shoulder really is repaired.</p>\n",

I'm finding the same thing -- it dominates my mood and thinking -- whether it's how the shoulder hurts, the psychology of maneuvering with the sling, whatever.\n\nOther than just being on my mind a lot, I'm writing so much for a couple of other reasons. First, as a reminder to myself over the years of the specifics of the injury and recovery. Second, because as I progress through this, I'm finding relevant information about what everything feels like to be tough to find on the web, and I hope that it can help others who are going through it.\n\nMy last post was a couple of weeks after the surgery, and we're now a couple of weeks past that -- I saw the surgeon Tuesday and things looked good enough to stop wearing the sling and start physical therapy. I'm <em>really </em>happy not to wear the sling anymore. The physical aspects were annoying, but it was really the psychological aspects that I was getting tired of -- being in a sling for weeks, I found that I started to think of myself as less vital, more gimpy. I knew it wasn't really true, and it was just temporary, but it wore on me a lot in any case.\n\nOverall, things are going well -- it's been pretty painful overall -- and lately my shoulder hurts most of the time (although it goes up and down). Sleeping has consistently been the biggest problem. Was hard to sleep with the sling, is hard to sleep with the soreness and sharp pains when I move in the wrong way. But making it through.\n\nWednesday I started physical therapy -- I've got 2 weeks of passive stretching &amp; range of motion exercises (I move the arm with my other arm, or the physical therapist moves it) and then another couple of weeks of active range of motion (where I use the arm itself). After that, 4 weeks of resistance training rehab, and who knows after that. So now I'm about 5 days into it. The exercises aren't complicated -- it's about 30 minutes of laying with my arms wide, stretching them on an exercise ball, doing pendulums, etc. They're designed to stretch out the capsule that holds the shoulder. The point of the surgery is to tighten up the capsule -- and they overtighten it in surgery and use PT to loosen it to a manageable level.\n\nThe most interesting/freaky aspect of this phase is psychological, too -- the therapist on Wednesday moved my shoulder into positions that my brain <em>knows </em>will dislocate -- or rather would have dislocated before the repair. So when I start to approach those positions, I'm finding myself tense up and fight against the motion, which makes everything hurt more. I find it's also triggering a strong fear response -- just a very strong aversion to letting my arm get moved around, some feeling of nausea, etc. The next day, the first one where I was doing the exercises by myself with nobody to ask questions of, was actually a little scarier to me, just because it was a completely unknown feeling.\n\nThe good news is that, as of today, Day 5, things are going really well. The difference between today and last week is astonishing, and I'm finding that every day my range of motion is a little bit bigger, and the fear &amp; nausea responses are becoming less severe and happening less often. It hurts most of the time -- there's not really any time that goes by that I'm not aware of it and devoting some attention to it. But it feels pretty good in the mornings now, and hurts more through the day as it gets more tired.\n\nI find, too, that I'm trying to be as aggressive as I can about it -- doing the exercises a couple of times a day instead of just once (I asked whether that would be okay) -- so hopefully that's helping. I know I can't accelerate it that much -- I think a lot of it is just diligence and time to heal.\n\nThe most amazing thing so far is that I can't remember, <em>at all, </em>what the surgery and rehab was like when I first repaired the shoulder, in a much more invasive open procedure, in 1990. I literally can't remember going to a physical therapist, can't figure out when I got better, since I didn't take any time off from school, and can only vaguely remember being in the hospital (it was a 3 day thing instead of just the morning like this year). I can remember a lot about both years at Stanford before and after it, but really nothing about getting my shoulder better. Weird.\n\nAnyway, this note is a little all over the place, which is a little how I feel, too. :-) But I'm happy to be more active now, and optimistic that the rehab is going well and starting to convince myself that my shoulder really is repaired.\n",

I couldn't recommend more reading that history.</p>\n<p>In this book, he recaps a bit of that -- goes through the last hundred years or so of Iranian history -- but in a parallel way, also chronicles the last hundred years of Turkish history. His basic argument is that, even though Saudi Arabia and Israel are our main partners in the region, and should remain partners, the overemphasis on those two countries is strange (for reasons I'll state in a moment) and unproductive &amp; dangerous, and that it's in our best interests to develop significant partnerships with both Turkey and Iran.</p>\n<p>He spends the time on history to show that the people of both countries have a longer history of wanting democracy and trying to bring democracy to their countries than any other countries in the region -- the difference being that Turkey's march towards democracy has been mostly unbroken, while Iran's was massively disrupted by foreign involvement in the 1950s, which created the conditions to allow the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution\">1979 Islamic Revolution</a> to occur.</p>\n<p>It's really important to note 2 things. First, he's not arguing that the governments are more democratic than elsewhere in the region, he's arguing that the rank and file populace have a longer history with and very strong desire for democracy. Secondly, he's not naive about the challenges of partnering, or that many compromises would have to be made -- but in his view the set of choices which could result in an enduring, positive situation are very limited, and these are the ones most in our self-interest.</p>\n<p>I liked this book a lot, both for the histories and the policies -- much to think on.</p>\n",

They both clearly admire the work as a way of helping them think about their own writing, and the way that writing is changing.</p>\n<p>It's a funny sort of book -- really a collection of about 800 numbered passages, some of which are only 3 or 4 words, some which stretch to 3 or 4 pages. Some of them are Shield's own writing, lots of them are cribbed from other authors.</p>\n<p>His main point is that the novel is dead. More particularly, that the constraints of the novel mean that they're so predictable and artificial -- so awkward and divorced from the pace and intensity and authenticity of modern life -- that they're uniformly unchallenging and interesting for him. More fundamentally, he argues that <i>all writing</i> is fiction. Non-fiction, history, memoir, novels, poems, essays, etc - that they are all a construct of a mix of human memories. He more or less says that Andy Kaufman was right -- that everything blurs. He cites a variety of examples of the trend, including some Eggers' work and some of Frey's. (In his view, Stephen Frey should have gone back on Oprah, not to take his beating by self-important critics, but rather to help people understand this idea):</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"When Frey, LeRoy, Defonseca, Seltzer, Rosenblat, Wilkomirski, et al. wrote their books, of course they made things up. Who doesn’t? Each one said sure, call it a novel, call it a memoir; who’s going to care? I don’t want to defend Frey per se—he’s a terrible writer—but the very nearly pornographic obsession with his and similar cases reveals the degree of nervousness on the topic. The whole huge loud roar, as it returns again and again, has to do with the culture being embarrassed at how much it wants the frame of reality and, within that frame, great drama.</p>\n<span class=\"highlight\">...</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n  <span class=\"highlight\">I’m disappointed not that Frey is a liar but that he isn’t a better one. He should have said, Everyone who writes about himself is a liar. I created a person meaner, funnier, more filled with life than I could ever be. He could have talked about the parallel between a writer’s persona and the public persona that Oprah presents to the world. Instead, he showed up for his whipping.</span>\"\n</blockquote>\n<p>He doesn't really argue that novels will actually disappear -- more that they are occupying a less and less central place in our culture.</p>\n<p>I highlighted more passages in this book than I have in a really long time, even though I don't really like the premise -- but I know that Shields is correct about single-author long form work receding in importance, and very quickly.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think this is a really important piece of work for anyone who's interested in where writing is headed at the moment. It's a little sad to me, but really probably isn't good or bad, just a reflection of today's fragmented, multi-media, always synthetic culture.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite set of passages:</p>\n<div class=\"highlightRow yourHighlight\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>To think with any seriousness is to doubt. Thought is indistinguishable from doubt. To be alive is to be uncertain. I’ll take doubt. The essayist argues with himself, and the essayist argues with the reader. The essay enacts doubt; it embodies it as a genre. The very purpose of the genre is to provide a vehicle for essaying.</p>\n\n    <p>...</p>\n\n    <p>When we are not sure, we are alive.</p>\n\n    <p>...</p>\n\n    <p>I don't know what it's like inside you and you don't know what it's like inside me.

He talks about all sorts of music that he's loved, bands that he's hung out with. He talks about how powerful music is -- says when he hears \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" he's about ready to join the IRA; how listening to \"Sweet Home Alabama\" makes him want to drink beer and shoot things, along with some less charitable emotions.</p>\n<p>Skewers lots of really awful music, like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I said before that there is no objectively “bad” music. I must now amend that statement. In so doing, let me cite Duke Ellington, who once famously declared that “there are only two kinds of music: good music and bad music. And by bad music I mean specifically the song ‘(I Bless the Rains Down in) Africa’ by Toto.” Ellington died two years before Toto formed as a band, which speaks to his prescience.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and later in that chapter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"What makes “(I Bless the Rains Down in) Africa” so bad? Mostly, it’s the lyrics. Also, the instrumentation, the vocals, and that virulent jazz-lite melody, which, despite the manifest wretchedness of everything I’ve just mentioned, means that you are no doubt conjuring the song even as you read this—those hypnotic banks of synthesizer and phony “tribal”-sounding drums—and without at all meaning to, sort of … grooving to “(I Bless the Rains Down in) Africa,” sort of digging it, sort of bathing in the buttery memory of sixth grade or tenth grade and hand jobs and lip gloss and really actually kind of remembering, or rediscovering, how much you love “(I Bless the Rains Down in) Africa” even as you’re hating yourself for this love. It’s complicated.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's comedy gold right there. Leads right up to him talking about his early dating life, where he really, really liked a woman until they went to her house and she was so excited to put on Air Supply's Greatest Hits, whereupon he immediately wanted to stop seeing her. But then considered that that make him shallow. And then decided to break up anyway.</p>\n<p>Great book. Highly recommended.</p>\n",

Anyway, it came out, and Kathy was good enough to hold my forearm for me so that I could get my shoulder back in the socket.</p>\n<p>This is a bit of a longstanding problem for me. I first dislocated my shoulder when I was 14 years old (give or take) &ndash; our soccer team had practice one evening, but another team was using the field, so we were warming up on the asphalt basketball court. I was dribbling around a guy but tripped over his foot, and caught my fall with my left arm, and my shoulder popped out. It took about 90 minutes to get me to the hospital and see a doctor &ndash; when I saw one, he lifted my arm above my head, and the shoulder got reseated, much to my relief.

So I decided to see a surgeon about doing something more to repair it.</p>\n<p>In either 1990 or 1991, I had surgery near Dallas &ndash; something called a Bankart procedure to repair the tear in my labrum and to retension the capsule.

Was in the hospital for 3 or 4 days, then a ton of rehab after that.</p>\n<p>But the really, really great news was that my arm didn&rsquo;t dislocate anymore. I lost some range of motion in the shoulder, basically because they tightened the capsule more than &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; But it was definitely worth it to have a more stable shoulder.

But I recently read the whole thing, and am glad I stuck with it.</p>\n<p>I'm interested in running -- I try to do it a few times a week, even though, as Murakami puts it, it highlights that I'm a very imperfect man, living an imperfect life. (That's actually a hopeful sentiment to me -- that we're all living imperfect lives, but still try to get out there and run.)</p>\n<p>This book is a few different stories: it's the story of several tribes of long distance runners (100 mile +) in Mexico, a report on ultra-distance running here in the states as well as the rise of barefoot running, and a bit of an evolutionary biology story about why humans are nature's greatest distance runners (in terms of stamina, not speed).</p>\n<p>I have to say, I believed some of it, but not all of it -- it felt like a bit of a marketing piece for barefoot running. But it was also a fun book, and helped me understand running a bunch better. I don't know whether I'll ever run a marathon, let alone an ultra-marathon, but it was neat to try to imagine that a little bit.</p>\n<p>I've been experimenting with running in my Vibrams about once a week or so -- so far, I'm liking the experience of forefoot striking, and the way that it helps me focus on engaging my core. Not sure I'm sold on running that way all the time, but definitely plan to keep it in the mix to vary my workouts.</p>\n",

I think it&rsquo;s not true, really &ndash; certainly not for everyone &ndash; but I even think that this distinction between &ldquo;normal people&rdquo; and &ldquo;tinkerers&rdquo; or &ldquo;techies&rdquo; or &ldquo;makers&rdquo; is bogus at best, and really dangerously corrosive at worst.</p>\n<p>So like Ben, I&rsquo;ll get an iPad and am really excited about it from an interaction point of view (so please be clear, this is not an anti-iPad rant or an anti-Apple rant), and because it makes computing more human scale than ever &ndash; just like my Kindle has done. But I have real misgivings about it because of the controlled, closed stance that it&rsquo;s starting from, and that other technology companies and technologists are adopting.</p>\n<p>But first, a little bit of a story about my own background and evolution as an engineer, and how that happened at all.</p>\n<p>When I was growing up, I remember my dad futzing around with everything. I remember him having a workshop in each of the houses we lived in (we moved around every few years as the Air Force stationed him in different places). I remember him working on our cars, our plumbing, and on our electrical systems in every house, on appliances, everything. I remember we seem to have built a deck for every house we ever lived in.</p>\n<p>But I have this especially strong memory that until I was probably 10 or 11, every television we bought would come in a kit, as a box full of parts, that Dad would put together &ndash; it was always a project for him. Now, as a kid, having a Heathkit television was basically mortifying. I mean, I just wanted us to go buy a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; television at Sears like everyone else did. Our TV didn&rsquo;t look like other folks, and being different as a kid is always a tough feeling.</p>\n<p>And, in fact, our first computer was a Sinclair Z-80 that, you guessed it, came in a kit. Then, since there was no prepackaged software to run on it, I typed in a bunch of BASIC programs from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BYTE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> magazine. Good times.</p>\n<p>The upside of that awkward feeling as a kid, though, has been significant and long lasting. The upside is that I&rsquo;ve never really viewed technology as something that was magic. It always had components that added up to the whole, that you could replace, that you could mix in different ways. I&rsquo;ve always felt like technology (and organizations, and laws, and most everything else) comes to us in a way that we should be poking at it, thinking about how things work, wondering how to make things better, wondering what would happen if you removed certain things.</p>\n<p>I think people will say to me: &ldquo;Well, of course. You&rsquo;re an engineer; you&rsquo;re a tinkerer. That&rsquo;s what engineers do &ndash; normal people don&rsquo;t assume they can rewire their house, or swap out a power supply on their TV or change the way an operating system works.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But I think that&rsquo;s bogus. It&rsquo;s not like I was born an engineer &ndash; the instinct to fiddle with things isn&rsquo;t something we&rsquo;re born with. I became a tinkerer because I was exposed to surfaces that allowed &ndash; that invited &ndash; it. I figured out that I liked tweaking and building and creating because I got a bunch of chances to do that stuff, from hardware to software and everything in between. I knew I could do it because Dad modeled that behavior, but also because the stuff we had around the house was inspectable and malleable.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t misunderstand: I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a real problem that I can&rsquo;t change the capacitors in my television today &ndash; I think that the most interesting surfaces for tinkering tend to evolve over time &ndash; and today the primary tinkering substrate appears to me to be the open web.</p>\n<p>What I do think is a problem is that today, unless you buy the Apple SDK you can&rsquo;t modify the software on the device that you already purchased &ndash; that jailbreaking is criminalized and actively fought against. That&rsquo;s a problem not because $99 is so exorbitant, but because people who don&rsquo;t know they could be tinkerers &ndash; who haven&rsquo;t gotten the chances that they need &ndash; won&rsquo;t ever get them in that situation. That&rsquo;s a problem.</p>\n<p>I do think there&rsquo;s tremendous creativity being unleashed by the rise of the iPhone and next the iPad &ndash; that&rsquo;s a great thing. And I don&rsquo;t really have any problem with Apple building systems the way they want to &ndash; they create excellent products and experiences.</p>\n<p>The thing that I&rsquo;m worried about is this feeling that seems to be growing in technology communities that &ldquo;normal people&rdquo; &ndash; these non-tinkerers &ndash; don&rsquo;t want to tweak things, shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to tweak things, can&rsquo;t be trusted with technical matters. Many will choose not to, I completely agree. But we shouldn&rsquo;t presume such.</p>\n<p>We all have the potential inside us to make things. But we&rsquo;re not born into the world as makers &ndash; the world around us &ndash; the people in it and the artifacts in it &ndash; help us to discover what we can be.</p>\n",

That's what engineers do -- normal people don't assume they can rewire their house, or swap out a power supply on their TV or change the way an operating system works.\"\n\nBut I think that's bogus. It's not like I was born an engineer -- the instinct to fiddle with things isn't something we're born with. I became a tinkerer because I was exposed to surfaces that allowed -- that invited -- it. I figured out that I liked tweaking and building and creating because I got a bunch of chances to do that stuff, from hardware to software and everything in between. I knew I could do it because Dad modeled that behavior, but also because the stuff we had around the house was inspectable and malleable.\n\nDon't misunderstand: I don't think it's a real problem that I can't change the capacitors in my television today -- I think that the most interesting surfaces for tinkering tend to evolve over time -- and today the primary tinkering substrate appears to me to be the open web.\n\nWhat I do think is a problem is that today, unless you buy the Apple SDK you can't modify the software on the device that you already purchased -- that jailbreaking is criminalized and actively fought against. That's a problem not because $99 is so exorbitant, but because people who don't know they could be tinkerers -- who haven't gotten the chances that they need -- won't ever get them in that situation. That's a problem.\n\nI do think there's tremendous creativity being unleashed by the rise of the iPhone and next the iPad -- that's a great thing. And I don't really have any problem with Apple building systems the way they want to -- they create excellent products and experiences.\n\nThe thing that I'm worried about is this feeling that seems to be growing in technology communities that \"normal people\" -- these non-tinkerers -- don't want to tweak things, shouldn't be allowed to tweak things, can't be trusted with technical matters. Many will choose not to, I completely agree. But we shouldn't presume such.\n\nWe all have the potential inside us to make things. But we're not born into the world as makers -- the world around us -- the people in it and the artifacts in it -- help us to discover what we can be.\n",

I&rsquo;ve read maybe a hundred books, at least a couple of over a thousand pages, and would not trade it. It is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->decidedly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not a perfect device, and is&hellip;what&rsquo;s the word?&hellip;oh, right: ugly. But it gets a lot right for the way that I use it.</p>\n<p>But I&rsquo;ve also been experimenting with reading on my iPhone (via the Kindle app) and on my laptop (again, via the Kindle app) &ndash; and I&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->written about some of my early experience in that mode<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And when I say &ldquo;experimenting,&rdquo; what I mean is that I&rsquo;ve been reading whole, long form books on it. When I went to Austin a couple of weeks ago, I intentionally didn&rsquo;t bring my Kindle, preferring to try traveling without it.</p>\n<p>And I&rsquo;ve been trying to read longer chapters and parts of books on my laptop, through the Kindle application for Windows.</p>\n<p>So the first conclusion is one that I&rsquo;ve made before: it&rsquo;s having your book content in the cloud that really makes the big difference. Being able to read your books on any screen that you happen to have with you is the thing that matters.</p>\n<p>But beyond that, I&rsquo;m finding that I&rsquo;m a more capable and thoughtful reader when I use the Kindle, as opposed to the other devices. It&rsquo;s a little hard to explain, but I can maintain a certain stillness and focus when I&rsquo;m using the Kindle that I haven&rsquo;t been able to achieve when reading on the iPhone or laptop &ndash; I find that on those 2 devices, I&rsquo;m a little fidgety, and my mind tends to wander towards all the other things I can do on them. My retention isn&rsquo;t as good as it is when I&rsquo;m reading on the Kindle itself, and my attention span isn&rsquo;t as long.</p>\n<p>I think there are a few factors here:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But for me, the Kindle is the must-have device for reading, with the iPhone app a very nice-to-have that I use sometimes, and the laptop really as an only occasional use device &ndash; it&rsquo;ll get better when they introduce searching and cataloging, but won&rsquo;t ever be primary.</p>\n<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know how that will change, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for me, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with the advent of the iPad.

				"content_text": "In the main, this isn't a post about the iPad, although there's a bunch of relevance there, and the conclusion mostly is about the iPad.\n\nI've been experimenting with different reading form factors for digital books over the last few weeks -- I've of course had my various Kindles (Kindlii?) for a couple of years now, and have basically come to love them. I've read maybe a hundred books, at least a couple of over a thousand pages, and would not trade it. It is <em>decidedly </em>not a perfect device, and is...what's the word?...oh, right: ugly. But it gets a lot right for the way that I use it.\n\nBut I've also been experimenting with reading on my iPhone (via the Kindle app) and on my laptop (again, via the Kindle app) -- and I've <a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2009/03/12/kindle-kindle-on-iphone/\">written about some of my early experience in that mode</a>. And when I say \"experimenting,\" what I mean is that I've been reading whole, long form books on it. When I went to Austin a couple of weeks ago, I intentionally didn't bring my Kindle, preferring to try traveling without it.\n\nAnd I've been trying to read longer chapters and parts of books on my laptop, through the Kindle application for Windows.\n\nSo the first conclusion is one that I've made before: it's having your book content in the cloud that really makes the big difference. Being able to read your books on any screen that you happen to have with you is the thing that matters.\n\nBut beyond that, I'm finding that I'm a more capable and thoughtful reader when I use the Kindle, as opposed to the other devices. It's a little hard to explain, but I can maintain a certain stillness and focus when I'm using the Kindle that I haven't been able to achieve when reading on the iPhone or laptop -- I find that on those 2 devices, I'm a little fidgety, and my mind tends to wander towards all the other things I can do on them. My retention isn't as good as it is when I'm reading on the Kindle itself, and my attention span isn't as long.\n\nI think there are a few factors here:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The backlit LED screens just really are not as good for your eyes for reading text. There's a dynamism to the letters from the lighting, I think, that makes it a little harder for me to focus on the letterforms. And I have this feeling that my eyes get fatigued much more quickly with backlit screens.</li>\n\t<li>For the iPhone, the screen is just too small to read books without feeling like they have a <em>million </em>pages. So every book feels super long. It's sort of like reading e-mail on your phone -- you always find yourself thinking \"holy cow, this is a long note\" and then when you look at it on your laptop, you discover it was only a couple of lines.</li>\n\t<li>For both the iPhone and laptop, I think I have different mental associations about what I do with them -- so I found myself switching back and forth between apps quite a lot -- which of course took me out of the flow of the book.</li>\n\t<li>The laptop sucks in all sorts of ways for long form reading. There's a keyboard between me &amp; the screen, for example. The pixel density isn't all that great. Just to name a couple.</li>\n\t<li>The screen on my Kindle is <em>clean.</em> I am pretty fanatical about keeping my Kindle screen free of gunk -- I really don't touch it at all, and am careful about wiping it off when I need to. I'm also a little neurotic (shocking, I know), about keeping my phone (whether iPhone or Nexus One) clean, but there's <em>always </em>a layer of grime on there, just because I manipulate the UI with my fingers constantly. [New learning: this is doubly gross when you're home sick. Gah.] Even with the <em>extremely </em>cool oleophobic screens that Apple has created, my iPhone is just grimy.</li>\n\t<li>The last thing is the battery life -- I usually don't leave the wireless on for my Kindle, which results in something like 3 weeks of actual use in battery life. I just don't ever worry about whether it'll run out or not. With the iPhone, I can't usually get more than about 13 hours -- so when I fly, I'm jealous about how I use it, and I've got battery meters running in my head regarding how to keep it charged.</li>\n</ul>\nI'm the first to recognize that I'm not all that typical a reader -- the volume of text I consume, whether long form like text, micro form like twitter, or article length like the web, is pretty high. And I read as much for pleasure as I do for work.\n\nBut for me, the Kindle is the must-have device for reading, with the iPhone app a very nice-to-have that I use sometimes, and the laptop really as an only occasional use device -- it'll get better when they introduce searching and cataloging, but won't ever be primary.\n\nNow, I don't know how that will change, <em>for me, </em>with the advent of the iPad. First off, I'll very likely get one -- this isn't about that, it's about whether I'll read most books on it. I think they've done a number of very nice things in the user experience on it, and it looks like a more intimate media device than I've ever seen, really.\n\n[As an aside, I noticed a ton of UI elements that seemed bizarre. A wood grain bookshelf actually in the graphics? Showing the pages and the bindings of the books? The spiral tab in the date book? Weird throwbacks to already out-of-date physical forms -- I guess intended to be for the metaphor bridge for the mass market, but still weird.]\n\nIt's a little hard to tell until I get to read longer books on an iPad, but I don't think it's going to be the book-reading device for me.\n\nI think it <em>will </em>be exceptional for many other things, and for people who don't read as many books, or mostly read shorter form material, it's going to be very worth paying the additional money to get the functionality over the Kindle. In other words, for people for whom reading is an occasional activity, or for just a few minutes a day, I think the iPad and devices like it will be fine.\n\nI have a nagging suspicion that it will continue the erosion of our ability to read long form books, and actually to make long form arguments -- with our politics and our marketing and everything else turning into snippets, I think that's not such a great thing. But I recognize that's a curmudgeony attitude.\n\nI just get the feeling that the ability to watch movies and listen to music and swipe pictures around, etc etc, on a device that is people's primary way to also consume books, will mean that the relative time spent reading will go down.\n\nSome other random thoughts:\n<ul>\n\t<li>It's good to have more readers in the market -- I think that will help everyone.</li>\n\t<li>I'm very glad they chose a relatively standard format -- ePub -- that's a great thing, even though it includes DRM. But I trust the DRM will go away over time.</li>\n\t<li>Having said that, the extent of a book catalog shows itself <em>very </em>quickly. There's a huge difference, for real readers, between catalogs that have the bestsellers and more comprehensive ones. The Amazon Kindle catalog is quite comprehensive at this point -- I only run into about 1 in every 5 books that I want that I can't get.</li>\n\t<li>Pretty disappointed in the connectors on the iPad -- am really tired of the iPhone connector, and wish they would move to micro USB like everyone else on the planet.</li>\n\t<li>I can't figure out why the early hands-on reviewers thought the virtual keyboard was going to feel great -- totally flat keyboards have <em>never </em>felt great. That may not matter, but I thought it was a weird expectation.</li>\n</ul>\nOver time, I'd expect the technology in both the Kindle and the iPad to get a lot cheaper -- I have a feeling that we may carry around more than one, since they'll be pretty slim and easy to throw into a bag. But we'll see.\n\nFor now, for me, I'll keep reading on my Kindle for the foreseeable future, even while swiping around on the iPad for more dynamic content.\n",

But setting that aside, I think it's a good device with a good operating system.\n\nA few thoughts on the comparisons -- I think I'm not adding much here that hasn't already been written:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The fit &amp; finish of the hardware I like on the Nexus One a little better than on my iPhone -- but you should take that with a grain of salt, since my iPhone is more than a year old.</li>\n\t<li>Nexus One is <em>much </em>faster than my 3G iPhone, which is getting slower and slower with higher latency all the time.</li>\n\t<li>The web is a much more legitimate first class citizen on Android than on the iPhone -- should be no surprise. It's just more integrated in dozens of ways. Not as totally web native as Palm, but still really good.</li>\n\t<li>Notifications on Android, and background processes that can fetch data and fire notifications, are <em>much, much </em>better than anything on iPhone. (Except for the inability to have app badges -- seems like they should add those soon.)</li>\n\t<li>And I <em>really </em>like that there are indicator lights -- the trackball and the charging light -- on the Nexus One to tell you things without needing to unlock the phone.</li>\n\t<li>The virtual keyboard on Android has some good advances, but ultimately doesn't enable the quick accuracy of the iPhone -- I think the iPhone is messing with hit targets as you type, depending on the likelihood for each letter -- and it helps tremendously.</li>\n\t<li>I'm no longer really worried about the lack of applications on Android -- it seems very clear that everyone will start writing apps for both iPhone and Android as first tier platforms -- but I am a little concerned about the quality of the app experience on Android -- the apps just don't feel like they're put together nearly as well. It seems like they can access more of the operating system than iPhone apps can, so they should ultimately be more compelling, but the user experience just is very inconsistent at best, and really awful at worst. This is clearly due to the SDK for each OS -- Apple's SDK just seems to allow developers to put together applications that feel better overall. <em>This is just one area where the battle feels a lot like we're repeating history with an Apple platform versus a more open platform.</em>\n</li>\n\t<li>Google Voice on the Nexus one is a <em>fantastic </em>experience. It's very clear that traditional telephony is walking dead.</li>\n</ul>\nAt the end of the day, though, my iPhone experience is just more intimate than my Android experience -- it feels more like it has my life on it, while the Android just feels like a very good phone and mobile web device. It's just easier to get more of what I care about -- my pictures, my music, my movies, games I like, and all my books (via the Kindle app) on my iPhone. So it feels more like an integrated part of my life than the Android. As frustrated as I am with my current iPhone 3G because of battery life &amp; sluggishness &amp; general physical-falling-apart, I still feel better when I have it than an Android.\n\nSo I'm encouraged by the advances of Android &amp; the Nexus One -- and fully expect that the huge array of players in the ecosystem will push things forward more quickly now -- ultimately, we as consumers really need a platform for our mobile lives that's an alternative to Cupertino -- not because of what Apple is <em>per se, </em>but because multiple choices means that everyone has to get better.\n",

I've found him to be the voice of my generation many times -- even including when he popularized the term \"Generation X\" for my generation -- in the title of his 1991 book <i>Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture.</i></p>\n<p>Looking back now, from 2010, it's clear that while we felt like life was accelerated in 1991, we had no idea how much faster culture and life would get -- that we'd see the fundamental innovation of the web start to take hold just a few years later, and the rate of change would just get faster and faster and faster.</p>\n<p>Coupland's themes have always really spoken to me -- he writes about the struggles we all go through to make meaning of our lives -- in his book <i>Life After God,</i> he explores the idea that in the past, in America, that religion and the church was the main organizing principle -- the connective tissue between events &amp; moments that ultimately shapes all of it into something coherent. But that religion, for many Gen Xers, has lost that narrative power -- and so we're all searching around for something else to take its place.</p>\n<p>The answer, naturally, has to be that nothing <i>can</i> take it's place, and finding meaning in your life was never really connected purely to religion anyway -- but the structure of activity and thought that religion brought made it a little easier. Finding meaning -- rather, <i>making meaning</i> -- is more intrinsic than that; it has to come from within yourself.</p>\n<p>But I've been having a hard time with Coupland's last few books -- they've been harder for me to believe &amp; internalize -- they're just a little more random and less accessible than I found his writing before. Or it may be that as he -- and I, and all of Generation X -- gets older that the ideas of alienation and narrative and meaning are getting harder to think about, harder to see -- so you have to just tell stories to try to get a glimpse at their truths.</p>\n<p>I liked this book; it's a little quirkier than I was hoping for, and I can't tell yet what meaning to make from it -- but think I may come back to it in a year or two to consider it again. (And it's already caused me to pick up <i>Life After God</i> again.)</p>\n",

Now he adds this one about the emperor Hadrian, who ruled about a century after Augustus established the empire (which was about 50 years after Cicero was at the height of his oratorical powers).</p>\n<p>While I liked his earlier 2 books better, I really enjoyed this one, too, and it was made more real because I took my first trip to Rome in November, while I was in the middle of reading it. Hadrian was directly responsible for the rebuilding of the Pantheon, the most incredible building that I saw on our trip -- and he came at a time just after the Flavians (Vespasian, Titus, Domitian), who reformed the city by building the Colosseum and much on the Palatine (not to mention, you know, the whole destruction of Jerusalem in there by Titus), and Trajan, who was as expansionist as any Roman emperor.</p>\n<p>The time that Everitt chronicles in these 3 books is really an amazing time in Roman (and world) history -- Rome was at the height of its power and influence -- after Hadrian, things were mostly in decline.</p>\n<p>Anyway, a must-read for anyone interested in Roman history (and if you are, let me know, because I've got a few others).</p>\n",

When I sent her something back, she noted it would be a good blog post, so here you go. :-)\n<ol>\n\t<li>First &amp; foremost, I treat my email as (probably my most important) work queue. (although that's both work and professional.) I don't really use it at all for information sources, etc.</li>\n\t<li>No bug mail of note goes into my e-mail. That's not really a decision so much as a responsibilities thing. but i think the volume of bugmail is so brutal that it's an e-mail destroyer. (So if I had to get a lot of it, I would segment into a different account.)</li>\n\t<li>I'm on basically zero mailing lists -- have other ways of reading that stuff.</li>\n\t<li>I try really hard to get my inbox to less than 20 messages before i leave each day; and 10 before I go to bed. Happens most of the time. I'm sitting on 6 messages in my inbox now, for example. Staying on top of things is *way* easier than getting on top.</li>\n\t<li>Any message that I can respond to quickly, I do, and then throw it away. I do that a lot on my iPhone, as I walk between meetings, wait for my lunch appointment to show up, whatever.</li>\n\t<li>If something is in my box that's going to take a while to get sorted out, I file it and move the task to my <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> list.</li>\n\t<li>Also, if it's going to take a few days to get back to someone, I generally send them a note to that effect -- that I'll get back to them. and sometimes, especially when I'm doing a favor for someone, I send a note that says \"if you don't hear from me by Tuesday, send me a note\"</li>\n\t<li>I try really hard to respond to everyone -- either the content of what they want, or the message that it'll be a while -- during the same day -- don't always get that done, but mostly. Generally, my inbox is a bunch of messages from \"Today\", a handful from \"Yesterday\" and some that have actual dates on them. If I note the dated ones getting too long ago, I generally think about how to make traction on them. (There's some core of ~3-4 messages that are on longer-running topics that sometimes I'm comfortable to just leave there since I know I'll get to them by the weekend.</li>\n</ol>\nAn observation I've had lately: I'm getting less mail than I used to. More is happening on twitter, IM, etc.\n\nIt's that combo of stuff that I do. I now pretty much don't file things away, either -- I put them either into \"FileToKeep\" (which I keep for a long time) or (mostly) into \"FileToTrash\" (which I clean out so that I only have 3 months of past mail in it).\n\nI think the critical things are: (1) treating it purely as a work queue (and getting off every other mailing, or separating to another account, like bugmail), (2) having a discipline about quickly giving *some* response, (3) moving long running tasks to a task list and (4) getting it very close to zero when you start, as I think it's difficult to whittle down over time (I've seen a lot of inboxes with thousands of messages in them -- don't know how you can do anything with those.)\n\nThat's what I do.

It's a history about the early 1500s, when Charles V and Clement VII and Henry VIII and Francis I dominated the European landscape, and Suleyman the Magnificent ruled in the East. Reston's done a fantastic job weaving together geographically dispersed but thematically very related activities, and I found it riveting.</p>\n<p>And, actually, the best of the 5 books he considers a cycle looking at the conflict between Christianity and Islam (and eventually between Christianity and science). It started with <i>The Last Apocalypse</i>, about the time period around 1000 AD, then the 3rd Crusade (<i>Warriors of God</i>), continued by looking at the Christian conquest of Spain (<i>Dogs of War</i>), through <i>Defenders of the Faith,</i> and concluding with <i>Galileo: A Life.</i></p>\n<p>At least Reston includes <i>Galileo</i> in his conception of the cycle -- I found it quite different in character than the other 4.</p>\n<p>But all 5 books are highly recommended -- among my favorite histories.</p>\n",

The second book centered more on a type of espionage. The third book, which isn't yet published in the US (but is in the UK, which is where my edition came from), wraps up a lot of loose ends, but I found it a little bit boring. Lots of basic police work, lots of courtroom dialog. Satisfying as a way to wrap things up, but not as intense as the first book or as wide open as the second.</p>\n",

I like reading his work because it covers a number of topics that I have a deep interest in, and covers them generally from a point of view that's original and different in background from my own. Plus, he's an extremely articulate guy, always.</p>\n<p>I think this is his most mainstream work to date -- it's an exploration of what's happening in our culture today -- which I've used the word \"synthetic\" for, but he calls the \"remix culture.\" Just the idea that modern media is all about blurring the lines between consumption and creation, and that mixing things together creates new things in the process. He articulates, quite clearly, that unless we change the way we think about creators &amp; consumers, and adjust our social norms and laws, we risk splitting our society between young &amp; old (at best) or criminalizing the acts of an entire generation (at worst).</p>\n<p>There were several parts of this book that have prodded new thinking for me -- one that I've been thinking about is related to long form reading -- what we've always called, you know, \"books.\" Larry talks about how a thousand years ago (give or take), Latin was the language of the elite &amp; educated class -- but the people who spoke &amp; valued Latin sort of missed the revolution of the masses -- the rise of the \"vulgar\" languages like Italian &amp; Spanish &amp; French. Similarly, the language of today is moving from the vocabulary of words to the vocabulary of sounds and images. That seems spot on to me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, a great book that captures a lot of the dynamic in media today -- recommended for sure.</p>\n",

After lunch each day we had smaller breakout sessions, facilitated by various leaders (my 2 were led by Jeff Jarvis of CUNY and Sue Gardner of Wikimedia) &ndash; those went a couple of hours and then the leaderes worked on a synthesis and summary to present to the whole group the next day.</p>\n<p>I talked with a few people who had been to events like this before, and I guess this felt a little bit on the large side, but with pretty great engagement and participation by some really outstanding people.</p>\n<p>I will note that it was not a particularly diverse group &ndash; white men over 40 dominated &ndash; but there were a number of women that participated, and a few other non-white-men. But with a subject like this &ndash; and in particular with it&rsquo;s relevance to how democracy works (or doesn&rsquo;t work) &ndash; I think we&rsquo;d all be best served with more diversity of thought &amp; background.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some Things That We&rsquo;ve Talked About<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>We started the sessions Monday by talking about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Knight Commission on the Needs of Communities in a Democracy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; Marissa, who&rsquo;s co-chair, gave an update on their progress and some thoughts about what may be in the report when they issue it later this year. It&rsquo;s going to be a report worth reading, and highlights both concerns about where journalism may be failing us as a democracy and some potential solutions.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s framed a lot of our discussions this week &ndash; the idea that democracies need certain services, some provided by journalists, to succeed and thrive. And John Carroll, the former editor of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Los Angeles Times, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->started with a definition: that journalism provides the information needed [for people] to be free and self-governing. (from <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Elements of Journalism<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by Kovach and Rosenstiel)</p>\n<p>I struggle with the focus on American journalism, for what it&rsquo;s worth. I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s the right way to think about the characteristics that are important for an engaged citizenry &ndash; because, clearly, there are other places in the world today where certain aspects of informing citizens are being much better served than here in the US. Still, I think that Scott Lewis (CEO of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->voiceofsandiego.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) said it best (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing): &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not really here to talk about saving newspapers or journalists' jobs &ndash; but there are some beautiful parts of the history of journalism in America, and we&rsquo;re here to talk about which those are and how to preserve the most beautiful and necessary in a time of change.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Scott&rsquo;s got it right, I think. It&rsquo;s not really about &ldquo;saving&rdquo; or &ldquo;preserving&rdquo; institutions &ndash; it should be about figuring out what we need in a modern world, what&rsquo;s possible with technology, and what characteristics and skills and ethics should be non-negotiable.</p>\n<p>One thing that I found particularly interesting is that there&rsquo;s not much concern at all about national &amp; international publications &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Financial Times<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, to name a few. The consensus is that those institutions, while under pressure and experimenting, will figure out how to survive. The most concern was about local papers, really, and about the loss of investigative journalism. And I think the basic assumption that most people here are making is that most metro newspapers will not be able to survive, at least not without change that will make them unrecognizable.</p>\n<p>That, too, seems right to me, and I have to say that I&rsquo;m not too sorry about this development. Local papers were always geographically-based monopolies &ndash; vertical integrations of information that had high barriers to entry due to the cost of printing &amp; distribution &amp; ad sales. It seems okay to me that they&rsquo;ll go away, by and large (because I think you&rsquo;ll get what you most need in different ways &ndash; classifieds by things like CraigsList, sports news from any number of places, local event information from hyper-local blogs, and investigative reporting from a couple of new classes of org that I&rsquo;ll talk about below). It&rsquo;s sad when newspapers disappear, for sure &ndash; many of these are 50 or 100 year institutions that have served their public well &ndash; but I think that in the overall scheme of things, this is not such a terrible problem.</p>\n<p>The breakup of these vertically integrated companies will mean that there&rsquo;s a much more complicated creation chain that will happen, and that we&rsquo;ll get our news and information in increasingly unique (to each of us) ways. I&rsquo;m most hopeful that this will allow smaller, more focused organizations to contribute however they&rsquo;re best able to contribute. I think that will mean a mix of non-profit and for-profit, a mix of big &amp; small, a mix of points-of-view, purposes, and ways of working. I think there is no doubt that this will be a hugely chaotic time as we evolve into what&rsquo;s next, and I think it will be some time while we all learn how to read again (understanding point-of-view, and the way that stories are constructed), but eventually we&rsquo;ll be in a better place than ever.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m encouraged by the work of many of the attendees, but in particular these: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Voice of San Diego<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Center for Investigative Research<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pro Publica<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n",

But with a subject like this -- and in particular with it's relevance to how democracy works (or doesn't work) -- I think we'd all be best served with more diversity of thought &amp; background.\n\n<strong>Some Things That We've Talked About</strong>\n\nWe started the sessions Monday by talking about the <a href=\"http://www.knightcomm.org/\">Knight Commission on the Needs of Communities in a Democracy</a> -- Marissa, who's co-chair, gave an update on their progress and some thoughts about what may be in the report when they issue it later this year. It's going to be a report worth reading, and highlights both concerns about where journalism may be failing us as a democracy and some potential solutions.\n\nThat's framed a lot of our discussions this week -- the idea that democracies need certain services, some provided by journalists, to succeed and thrive. And John Carroll, the former editor of the <em>Los Angeles Times, </em>started with a definition: that journalism provides the information needed [for people] to be free and self-governing. (from <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Journalism-Newspeople-Should-Public/dp/0609806912\">The Elements of Journalism</a>, </em>by Kovach and Rosenstiel)\n\nI struggle with the focus on American journalism, for what it's worth. I don't know that that's the right way to think about the characteristics that are important for an engaged citizenry -- because, clearly, there are other places in the world today where certain aspects of informing citizens are being much better served than here in the US. Still, I think that Scott Lewis (CEO of <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org\">voiceofsandiego.org</a>) said it best (I'm paraphrasing): \"We're not really here to talk about saving newspapers or journalists' jobs -- but there are some beautiful parts of the history of journalism in America, and we're here to talk about which those are and how to preserve the most beautiful and necessary in a time of change.\"\n\nScott's got it right, I think. It's not really about \"saving\" or \"preserving\" institutions -- it should be about figuring out what we need in a modern world, what's possible with technology, and what characteristics and skills and ethics should be non-negotiable.\n\nOne thing that I found particularly interesting is that there's not much concern at all about national &amp; international publications -- <em>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, </em>or <em>The Financial Times</em>, to name a few. The consensus is that those institutions, while under pressure and experimenting, will figure out how to survive. The most concern was about local papers, really, and about the loss of investigative journalism. And I think the basic assumption that most people here are making is that most metro newspapers will not be able to survive, at least not without change that will make them unrecognizable.\n\nThat, too, seems right to me, and I have to say that I'm not too sorry about this development. Local papers were always geographically-based monopolies -- vertical integrations of information that had high barriers to entry due to the cost of printing &amp; distribution &amp; ad sales. It seems okay to me that they'll go away, by and large (because I think you'll get what you most need in different ways -- classifieds by things like CraigsList, sports news from any number of places, local event information from hyper-local blogs, and investigative reporting from a couple of new classes of org that I'll talk about below). It's sad when newspapers disappear, for sure -- many of these are 50 or 100 year institutions that have served their public well -- but I think that in the overall scheme of things, this is not such a terrible problem.\n\nThe breakup of these vertically integrated companies will mean that there's a much more complicated creation chain that will happen, and that we'll get our news and information in increasingly unique (to each of us) ways. I'm most hopeful that this will allow smaller, more focused organizations to contribute however they're best able to contribute. I think that will mean a mix of non-profit and for-profit, a mix of big &amp; small, a mix of points-of-view, purposes, and ways of working. I think there is no doubt that this will be a hugely chaotic time as we evolve into what's next, and I think it will be some time while we all learn how to read again (understanding point-of-view, and the way that stories are constructed), but eventually we'll be in a better place than ever.\n\nI'm encouraged by the work of many of the attendees, but in particular these: <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org\">Voice of San Diego</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.centerforinvestigativereporting.org\">Center for Investigative Research</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org\">Pro Publica</a>.\n",

He's best known as the dino-tech-advisor expert for the <i>Jurassic Park</i> movies, but his day job is as a professor at Montana State University and as head of the Museum of the Rockies -- his focus, of course, is paleontology.</p>\n<p>I got to hear him talk with a big group of high schoolers -- and to get them to think through in a reasoned way how we could tell how social &amp; smart certain dinosaurs were from the fossil record -- a line of thinking that he pioneered decades ago, and which ultimately lent credibility to the idea that birds are essentially avian dinosaurs.</p>\n<p>The really fun thing when you talk with Dr. Horner, other than the fact that he's extremely iconoclastic, is that within a couple of minutes, you can tell that he can actually see the dinosaurs in his mind's eye -- that for him, they're very alive and active. He'd like that to be true for everyone and he'd like to see that vision made more real:</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" id=\"AA22PDF9HNS6D7F0JIFKWJ62OB5P\"></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Well, paleontologists may deal with the long dead. But at the heart of all the digging and preparation of skeletons and museum displays is the attempt to reconstruct the past, to re-create moments in the history of life. What we would really love to do, if we could, is bring ’em back alive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, the book starts out by explaining some basics of the archaeological timeline, and some specifics about the geography that Horner works in -- Montana. It talks about his first finds of giant T. Rex fossils, and then an accidental discovery -- once when they had to break a T. Rex femur in order to transport it, they found remnants of blood cells inside the bone -- and then they started pulling on the thread.<br></p>\n<p>That led them to the main story in this book, the shift from paleontology as mostly digging &amp; reconstruction to including sophisticated genetic analysis:</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" id=\"AA23Q0MQ93YH8K7GD8HVFL1FGFUT\"></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It became clear to some of us in paleontology that it was time for a change in the way we did our work. We didn’t need to give up the satisfying summer fieldwork, the digging up of the past, but we did need to add new tools. And we needed to go beyond the dissecting microscope, through which we could see fine details of bone structure. We needed to get down to the level of molecules in fossils—and in living things. By the 1980s molecular biologists were already using differences in genes in living creatures to calculate rates of evolution and to date events in evolution. They had developed a new stream of evidence to compete with or supplement the fossils weathering out of the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That, of course, changes everything. Much of the book is about the parallels between how fetuses develop and how evolution happens -- because it's often genetic markers turning on and off that determine whether things like tails develop.</p>\n<p>And the big insight of that type of analysis is that if you can change how embryos develop, you can, in a way, turn back the evolutionary clock -- you can do things like grow chickens with teeth (which has been done). Horner wants to do a few more things, including growing a chicken with a tail -- because it harkens back to what non-avian dinosaurs must have developed like. He says this:</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" id=\"AA54FUD1WL9FR2N3LI4HV542TN\"></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What I like about the idea of using a chicken that developed into a dinosaur as evidence of the reality of evolution is that it is more than an idea. It is an experimental result. And it calls out for questions. What is it? How did you do it? Is it a circus freak or a trick? What does it mean? Without staking out a position or starting a war of words, the animal would prompt a discussion that would have to end up with the mechanisms of evolution and its footprint in the genes of living animals. Even more than a fossil, it would cry out for explanation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's an amazing idea, and one that we seem to be heading towards. I'll leave the ethical &amp; scientific discussion to Horner -- there's much of that in the book and you can decide for yourself -- and just say that the whole idea is incredible. It seems clear to me that we'll see this sort of work in our lifetimes, and it will undoubtedly raise a whole raft of new questions. Here's how Horner ends (which is more of a beginning, really):</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" id=\"AA33KAAO3QVQ1W6I1QB9LXTPLS4V\"></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That would be the most satisfying lecture I could possible give. I don’t like providing answers. I never have. I like questions. I like asking them, trying to figure out answers, trying to figure out what we are really asking, and what new questions come up. For this event I won’t have to prepare any speech at all. My entire prepared text will consist of one simple question, from which everything else will follow. I’ll walk to the edge of the stage, point to the creature on the leash, look at the audience, and say, “Can anyone here tell me what this is? ”</p>\n</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m in Princeton, NJ, at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Institute of Advanced Studies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (home to many amazing people &amp; events, like Einstein, Oppenheimer, von Neuman, and more) for an event called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adventures of the Mind<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; 150 high potential high school students from across the US gathered together. They&rsquo;ve also invited ~40 mentors to give talks about how we got from there (high school) to here &ndash; flash talks of 10 minutes or so. So far last night &amp; this morning, we&rsquo;ve heard from 2 Nobel Laureates in Physics (of the 9 who are here!), 2 poet laureates of the US (including Billy Collins, who is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hilarious <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and read some amazing poetry), we&rsquo;ve heard from John Maeda and Annie Duke and Senator Patrick Leahy just got on stage to talk. So an intimidating lineup, for sure.</p>\n<p>For the record, when they announced that I work for Mozilla on Firefox, everyone burst into applause, so that helped a lot. :-)</p>\n<p>The emerging theme is that everyone who&rsquo;s had any type of success has had more than their fair share of mistakes, of periods of muddling through.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, this is what I said during my 10 minutes&hellip;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I started preparing for this talk like I always do: by blogging &amp; tweeting. I asked people what sorts of advice they&rsquo;d give to their high school selves that wouldn&rsquo;t sound like safely ignorable advice from an old guy. I didn&rsquo;t get back a ton that met that test, honestly, except the sentiment that no matter what I said, it&rsquo;ll probably sound like advice from an old guy (I&rsquo;m a little sensitive about getting older now because I just got back from my 20th high school reunion!).</p>\n<p>Vicky asked me to talk today about how we got where we are, and what we did to get here, and where we&rsquo;re heading.</p>\n<p>So as I started thinking about what to talk with all of you about, I found that I kept thinking about the turning points in my life &ndash; the inflection points where something I did or decided had a really profound impact on what my life would become. And it&rsquo;s not that hard &ndash; I can look back at the 20 years or so since I was sitting where you were (more or less), and pinpoint a bunch of them &ndash; maybe 5 or 10 that really made a difference.\nAnd here&rsquo;s the thing: thinking back on all of them, when I was making those decisions, I never really had much idea that they were very important decisions. Let me say that again: for most of the important turning points in my life, I treated them with a little less seriousness than, you know, buying my next iPod. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that I didn&rsquo;t recognize that sometimes decisions would have effects, or that I didn&rsquo;t take them seriously. What I&rsquo;m saying is that a bunch of decisions that I thought were really important turned out to be not important at all, and some things I decided to do just for fun changed everything (like when I went to visit an old high school friend in Jamaica who would eventually become my wife.)</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick story to illustrate a turning point that I didn&rsquo;t realize until much later. When I was a junior in college, I had decided to major in computer science, and was starting to get interested in something called Human Computer Interaction &ndash; designing systems for people to be able to use them effectively. I went to a lunchtime seminar by a guy named Robert Cailliau &ndash; a physicist from Switzerland of all places &ndash; and he brought with him a giant black computer called a NeXT &ndash; Steve Jobs' creation that would eventually turn into the Macintosh that we know today. He started giving a demo of a program where you could bring up a page full of text and pictures, and click on blue underlined text to get to other pages full of text and pictures. And I remember saying to myself, &ldquo;Huh, I guess that&rsquo;s sort of neat &ndash; text &amp; pictures, click click click.&rdquo; And the next thing I remember was waking up when everyone was gathering up all their stuff to leave &ndash; I had fallen asleep &ndash; and missed, of course, the first demonstration I&rsquo;d ever seen (or most people had ever seen) of the World Wide Web. So there you go &ndash; one of those powerful inflection points in my life &ndash; and I slept through it.</p>\n<p>My theme throughout my few minutes here is going to be this: you never know when a decision you make is going to have a profound effect in your life. At least, I&rsquo;ve never been able to tell. So my coping strategy &ndash; what I do to make everything work for me &ndash; is try to put myself into situations where there are tons of great choices, tons of great people, tons of great outcomes possible &ndash; so that it makes the odds that I make some really important &amp; good choices that much better.</p>\n<p>In high school, I felt like had everything pretty together &ndash; I loved math &amp; physics in particular, and did pretty well &ndash; figured that I&rsquo;d major in physics and if I didn&rsquo;t get straight A pluses, I&rsquo;d mostly get them. So of course I got to Stanford my freshman year, took my first physics class and proceeded to get my ass kicked. It was pretty horrifying, actually. Have you ever seen those bar charts with the numbers of people who got each grade? A histogram distribution of how everyone did? Yeah, so I had my own solitary bar, way over to the left hand side of the chart &ndash; and that&rsquo;s not the good side. I quickly decided maybe physics wouldn&rsquo;t be for me, but I did really start to enjoy computer science, and that&rsquo;s where I focused.</p>\n<p>Anyway, from Stanford I went to a startup in Austin where I realized I&rsquo;d never be world class at programming or designing, but I could be world class at some other stuff &ndash; things like finding great people and hiring them and building awesome groups.</p>\n<p>After a couple of years I went back to Apple, where I had been an intern during college &ndash; put yourself into situations where there are mostly great choices, remember? 1997 was an odd time at Apple &ndash; it&rsquo;s when Steve came back and changed the place immediately &ndash; he&rsquo;d always been a bit of an idol of mine. But as he started making decisions to change Apple, I saw them hurt a lot of the people there who I really cared about and respected &ndash; so then, at age 26, I decided it was time to start creating my own thing, and I set off with my mentor from Apple, my 2 best friends, and we started our own company, Reactivity. And through Reactivity, I got to meet and work with many of the people I&rsquo;m closest to now &amp; who are my mentors and peers and co-conspirators.</p>\n<p>We did that for 7 years before I decided it was time for me to do something else. (and a little while after I left, Reactivity was bought by Cisco, a happy event for everyone.)</p>\n<p>And then, as I say, another accident. I was looking around for what to do next &ndash; I thought I might start a new company or become a venture capitalist &ndash; but during that time I got to know this little team of people at Mozilla &ndash; there were probably 15 employees at the time (but a much larger community) &ndash; they had just released Firefox about 6 months earlier, and they were changing the world.

				"content_text": "I'm in Princeton, NJ, at the <a href=\"http://www.ias.edu\">Institute of Advanced Studies</a> (home to many amazing people &amp; events, like Einstein, Oppenheimer, von Neuman, and more) for an event called <a href=\"http://http://www.adventuresofthemind.org/custom/splash.asp?id=65\">Adventures of the Mind</a> -- 150 high potential high school students from across the US gathered together. They've also invited ~40 mentors to give talks about how we got from there (high school) to here -- flash talks of 10 minutes or so. So far last night &amp; this morning, we've heard from 2 Nobel Laureates in Physics (of the 9 who are here!), 2 poet laureates of the US (including Billy Collins, who is <em>hilarious </em>and read some amazing poetry), we've heard from John Maeda and Annie Duke and Senator Patrick Leahy just got on stage to talk. So an intimidating lineup, for sure.\n\nFor the record, when they announced that I work for Mozilla on Firefox, everyone burst into applause, so that helped a lot. :-)\n\nThe emerging theme is that everyone who's had any type of success has had more than their fair share of mistakes, of periods of muddling through.\n\nAnyhow, this is what I said during my 10 minutes...\n\n-------------------------\n\nI started preparing for this talk like I always do: by blogging &amp; tweeting. I asked people what sorts of advice they'd give to their high school selves that wouldn't sound like safely ignorable advice from an old guy. I didn't get back a ton that met that test, honestly, except the sentiment that no matter what I said, it'll probably sound like advice from an old guy (I'm a little sensitive about getting older now because I just got back from my 20th high school reunion!).\n\nVicky asked me to talk today about how we got where we are, and what we did to get here, and where we're heading.\n\nSo as I started thinking about what to talk with all of you about, I found that I kept thinking about the turning points in my life -- the inflection points where something I did or decided had a really profound impact on what my life would become. And it's not that hard -- I can look back at the 20 years or so since I was sitting where you were (more or less), and pinpoint a bunch of them -- maybe 5 or 10 that really made a difference.\nAnd here's the thing: thinking back on all of them, when I was making those decisions, I never really had much idea that they were very important decisions. Let me say that again: for most of the important turning points in my life, I treated them with a little less seriousness than, you know, buying my next iPod. Now, I'm not saying that I didn't recognize that sometimes decisions would have effects, or that I didn't take them seriously. What I'm saying is that a bunch of decisions that I thought were really important turned out to be not important at all, and some things I decided to do just for fun changed everything (like when I went to visit an old high school friend in Jamaica who would eventually become my wife.)\n\nHere's a quick story to illustrate a turning point that I didn't realize until much later. When I was a junior in college, I had decided to major in computer science, and was starting to get interested in something called Human Computer Interaction -- designing systems for people to be able to use them effectively. I went to a lunchtime seminar by a guy named Robert Cailliau -- a physicist from Switzerland of all places -- and he brought with him a giant black computer called a NeXT -- Steve Jobs' creation that would eventually turn into the Macintosh that we know today. He started giving a demo of a program where you could bring up a page full of text and pictures, and click on blue underlined text to get to other pages full of text and pictures. And I remember saying to myself, \"Huh, I guess that's sort of neat -- text &amp; pictures, click click click.\" And the next thing I remember was waking up when everyone was gathering up all their stuff to leave -- I had fallen asleep -- and missed, of course, the first demonstration I'd ever seen (or most people had ever seen) of the World Wide Web. So there you go -- one of those powerful inflection points in my life -- and I slept through it.\n\nMy theme throughout my few minutes here is going to be this: you never know when a decision you make is going to have a profound effect in your life. At least, I've never been able to tell. So my coping strategy -- what I do to make everything work for me -- is try to put myself into situations where there are tons of great choices, tons of great people, tons of great outcomes possible -- so that it makes the odds that I make some really important &amp; good choices that much better.\n\nIn high school, I felt like had everything pretty together -- I loved math &amp; physics in particular, and did pretty well -- figured that I'd major in physics and if I didn't get straight A pluses, I'd mostly get them. So of course I got to Stanford my freshman year, took my first physics class and proceeded to get my ass kicked. It was pretty horrifying, actually. Have you ever seen those bar charts with the numbers of people who got each grade? A histogram distribution of how everyone did? Yeah, so I had my own solitary bar, way over to the left hand side of the chart -- and that's not the good side. I quickly decided maybe physics wouldn't be for me, but I did really start to enjoy computer science, and that's where I focused.\n\nAnyway, from Stanford I went to a startup in Austin where I realized I'd never be world class at programming or designing, but I could be world class at some other stuff -- things like finding great people and hiring them and building awesome groups.\n\nAfter a couple of years I went back to Apple, where I had been an intern during college -- put yourself into situations where there are mostly great choices, remember? 1997 was an odd time at Apple -- it's when Steve came back and changed the place immediately -- he'd always been a bit of an idol of mine. But as he started making decisions to change Apple, I saw them hurt a lot of the people there who I really cared about and respected -- so then, at age 26, I decided it was time to start creating my own thing, and I set off with my mentor from Apple, my 2 best friends, and we started our own company, Reactivity. And through Reactivity, I got to meet and work with many of the people I'm closest to now &amp; who are my mentors and peers and co-conspirators.\n\nWe did that for 7 years before I decided it was time for me to do something else. (and a little while after I left, Reactivity was bought by Cisco, a happy event for everyone.)\n\nAnd then, as I say, another accident. I was looking around for what to do next -- I thought I might start a new company or become a venture capitalist -- but during that time I got to know this little team of people at Mozilla -- there were probably 15 employees at the time (but a much larger community) -- they had just released Firefox about 6 months earlier, and they were changing the world. So I joined. My basic line of reasoning went like this: how often do you get a chance to really change the world?\n\nI think not all that much, to be honest. Since then, I've moved through a few jobs at Mozilla, becoming the CEO about 18 months ago. Now we're up to about 250 employees around the world -- places like California and Toronto and Paris and Tokyo and Beijing and Auckland -- and about 300 million people (nearly 25% of the web) use our software each month to interact with the web.\n\nNow we're spending our time on a few things: working on making Firefox on Windows &amp; Mac &amp; Linux better than ever -- we just released version 3.5 last month, and are already working on the next few. We've got a mobile version coming out -- not for iPhone yet, but for some other handhelds -- because it's pretty clear that everyone is going to be using the web in their pocket from here on out. We're a 250 person company that's competing with Microsoft &amp; Apple &amp; Google -- all of whom are relentlessly working on and improving their own browsers. So it's never dull. Competing with these guys -- playing on this level -- is brutal -- there's always more to do just to stay in place, there are always challenges to react to. But now that I've done it, it's hard to imagine not being in this environment.\n\nCraig Newmark, founder of Craigslist, a couple of days ago in Aspen said as a joke that he was like the Forrest Gump of the Internet -- and you're all too young to even know what that reference is, but it comes from a movie where the title character, Forrest Gump, was accidentally around some of the most interesting events in the world over the period of his life. For Craig to say that is ridiculous, of course. The real thing is that Craig is a very smart dude, and he's been in situations where being smart and making choices can really matter. And so he's been able to change the world.\n\nI'll leave you with a couple of other thoughts, both given to me by one of my mentors, a professor at Stanford named Tom Kosnik.\n<ul>\n\t<li>find your peer group &amp; treat them right -- that means look around, find the peers who you really like and respect -- and keep in touch with them, visit with them, call them a lot (don't just facebook them!)</li>\n\t<li>do things that make your soul sing -- this one's easier, and I suspect will be a theme this weekend. But the shorthand is this: if you're not loving what you're doing, you've got to find something else to do. (which isn't to say you shouldn't work hard, or that it should always be fun -- just that you should enjoy the overall thing that you're doing.)</li>\n</ul>\nLast thing: take a few minutes to write down what you're feeling as you go through life -- and take a picture or two -- you'll end up doing some amazing things, and later on you'll value being able to go back and try to see through your younger eyes, trying to imagine and remember who you were and how it felt.\n",

There will be about 30-40 mentors, including a number of Nobel prize winners in science, poet laureates, very successful educators, thinkers &amp; business folks -- and me.\n\nSo here's the question I have for everyone: if you had 10 minutes to talk to, you know, someone like you 20 years earlier, what would you do with that 10 minutes?\n",

I think I figured I&rsquo;d come away with some sort of understanding or insight &ndash; some &ldquo;a ha&rdquo; about my high school experience and the intervening years and who I am now. I&rsquo;m not sure I got any of that insight, but I had a really wonderful time, and have at least a few thoughts on life 20 years on from the summer of 1989 when we all embarked from high school to build our lives.</p>\n<p>But first a couple of bits of background.</p>\n<p>The first thing I should say is that I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;my&rdquo; reunion, but it was really &ldquo;our&rdquo; 20th reunion: Kathy &amp; I were both Class of 1989 at MacArthur High School in San Antonio, where we had met 4 years earlier in marching band. That first year we didn&rsquo;t interact too much, but knew each other a little bit &ndash; then a little bit later we started dating. Then for a pretty long time we did whatever you&rsquo;d call the opposite of dating. Then a bit of indeterminate relationship status ensued. We cycled around a bit. I&rsquo;m sure everyone else thought it was sort of funny. (sort of.)</p>\n<p>Anyhow, we graduated and went off to opposite coasts; eventually reconnecting when Kathy was teaching in Jamaica and I was working in Austin in 1995. 5 years later, after a move to California, we got married, and then SPL came along a little over 4 years ago now. Your typical story.</p>\n<p>So we had a bit of an built-in advantage when it comes to enjoying the weekend &ndash; we had a bunch of shared history. And that part was really great.</p>\n<p>The second bit of context I should share is that I really liked high school a lot. Which is not to say that I was always happy &ndash; I remember that as a time of awkwardness and uncertainty &ndash; of trying to figure out what the hell to do and how the hell to act, and getting it wrong (or thinking I was) an awful lot of the time. But despite the awkwardness, Mac was really good for me, and some of the friendships and relationships and learnings from my time there form the foundation for how I operate today.</p>\n<p>I grew up an Air Force brat, always moving around every 3 or 4 years as Dad got stationed in all these exotic locations. (e.g. Omaha, Rome NY, San Antonio, Las Vegas, etc&hellip;) We lived in San Antonio from 8th through 12th grades for me, and that was a good solid stretch of time. It was interesting this weekend to see Kathy interact with people she&rsquo;s known since she was in 1st grade &ndash; so I guess more than 30 years now.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Mac was good for me partly because it was the first place my family stayed for a while, but also because of two incredibly outstanding experiences I was involved in: marching band and Latin club.</p>\n<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ll pause while you clean up the mess from that spit-take you just did when you realized what a stereotypical nerd I was then &ndash; and still am, really. We are who we are. :-)</p>\n<p>Band was singularly amazing. Friday nights in Texas are a bit of a thing &ndash; if you&rsquo;ve ever seen Friday Night Lights, I can attest that it really does feel like that; there&rsquo;s a momentum to high school Fridays in Texas that peaks at the football games and the hanging out that all the different groups did after the games. It&rsquo;s all a lot over the top, and, again, lives up to the stereotype. And band was a big part of those Fridays &ndash; and, like football, in Texas they went a little over the top with band competition. Something like 300 bands compete every year, finishing up with state finals in Longhorn Stadium at UT.</p>\n<p>The year before we were freshmen, the MacArthur Band and Flags had won the state championship &ndash; a first for the school &ndash; led by a band director who was a bit of an institution &ndash; everyone loved Bill Brady and wanted to do well for him. Our freshman year we started 3 weeks before school started &ndash; same time as the fall sports teams started &ndash; and the goal was to win the championship a 2nd year. A few months into the season, Mr. Brady had a heart attack and passed away unexpectedly &ndash; it&rsquo;s still a little emotional for me to think about &ndash; and was my first real experience with death.</p>\n<p>We all grieved for a while, and then picked ourselves up to try to do our best for him. And in a bit of a storybook turn, a couple of months later, on a rainy night at Longhorn Stadium, we won the state championship again. That&rsquo;s the first experience I can remember of bigness &ndash; a situation that felt larger than life, that&rsquo;s etched in my memory &ndash; and the first experience I can remember of a group of people being so focused, so locked in on what they were doing and where they were and who they could be &ndash; and everything just going right.</p>\n<p>The next year we were lucky to get another outstanding director and teacher, Linda McDavitt, We never quite won state again, but we did well in the following years, and in the band hall &amp; on the  marching field, we all learned together how to work hard, how to become really outstanding at something, how to try to catch a glimpse of transcendence. How to lead, and follow, and work together, really. It seems like a small thing, so many years ago, but I don&rsquo;t really know who I would have become without that experience.</p>\n<p>Latin contest was the same way for me, but even nerdier and probably less interesting to write about here &ndash; but it was just as important in helping me figure out who I was and what I cared about.</p>\n<p>There was a lot of other stuff, naturally, and lots of stuff we did (and much we really shouldn&rsquo;t have), but suffice it to say that I&rsquo;m really fond of that period in my life.

It was awesome to see them and the families that they&rsquo;ve built and strengthened over the years.

Some were easy to predict, some not so much.</p>\n<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s ultimately the lesson &ndash; that there aren&rsquo;t any real lessons.

And it seems to me that we&rsquo;re all so different, but still so the same &ndash; like we were in band, trying to become something great, to catch a glimpse of transcendence. The places we look for that are different &ndash; instead of band or football or schoolwork we may work hard to be great at work or to look for transcendence in a quiet dinner with your spouse or in your son&rsquo;s first smile.</p>\n<p>But the trying, the striving, seems to me to be the same, and I had a wonderful time sharing our own striving with everyone and hearing and seeing a little bit of theirs.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Just got back from a fantastic, if ridiculously hot, 20th high school reunion -- I've got some reflections I'm planning to post later tonight.</p>\n<p>But one of the problems with reunions generally is that they're only really focused on the graduating class of a particular year -- and, extremely importantly, not on the teachers who were so influential in influencing our thoughts and relationships. Reading <a href=\"http://lockshot.wordpress.com/2009/07/25/40th-anniversary-of-eop-and-marquette-alumni-reunion/\">Harvey's post about his own influences</a>, I decided I wanted to take a few minutes and write about the most influential school teachers in my own life -- I wanted to get it into <i>their permanent record,</i> so to speak.</p>\n<p>At least 2 of the 10 below have passed away, and several have retired -- but at least 2 or three are still teaching. I'd wager that a few of them knew that they had a meaningful impact on my life -- but I doubt any of them really know how much. A <i>lot,</i> it turns out -- so much so that I remember their names &amp; faces &amp; interactions 20 -- and in some cases 30 -- years later.</p>\n<p>So for the record, these are the most meaningful school teacher influences in my life so far -- they went way beyond the classroom and still affect me today. In more or less chronological order.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>Mrs. Kelly</b> was my kindergarten teacher in Rome, NY, and we just really, really got along. She was as kind, challenging, and supportive as anyone could ask. And when we got ready to move to Omaha for first grade, she came to my house and gave me a camera so I could take pictures of my journey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><br>\n<b>Mr. Fuke</b> was my 5th grade teacher at OK Adcock in Las Vegas Nevada (I must've had good teachers in Omaha, but don't really remember any). I remember Mr. Fuke for three primary reasons: (1) he was the first Hawaiian person I knew, (2) at the end of every day he made up a little more of a serial story -- I remember vampires, but who knows -- that had everyone in the class riveted, and (3) he was the first teacher who really was comfortable with letting me go at my own pace, and encouraging me to do it.<br>\n<b><br></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>Anthony Vicari</b> was our band director in 7th grade at Garside Junior High (Las Vegas), and also taught AT (academically talented). I remember loving those classes, just really loving them, and being challenged by them. I think he recently retired as a middle school principal, where he must have been fantastic.<br>\n<b><br></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>Bill Brady</b> was our band director freshman year at MacArthur in San Antonio. He died just a couple of months into the year, which was my first real experience with death. But the foundations that he had set up were strong, and the persistence of the organization was amazing. I'll write more about it in my post about the reunion, as band in high school was a singularly rewarding experience.<br>\n<b><br></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>Linda McDavitt</b> became Mac's band director the following year, coming into an impossible situation, following an institution, and she was amazing. I learned a lot about how to be a leader from her, as we went from sophomores to juniors to seniors and became the leaders of the band.<br>\n<b><br></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>Laura Niland</b> was my 10th grade Algebra 2 teacher at Mac, and has got to be the snarkiest teacher I ever had. She just really encouraged me to like math, and to have the fun that I did while doing it. She let us get away with a lot we probably shouldn't have, too.<br>\n<b><br></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>Drucie McRae</b> was my 10th grade English teacher -- she also probably let us get away with a lot we probably shouldn't have. Honestly, I don't remember a single book we read in that class or a single thing I wrote -- I don't even remember liking the content very much. But I remember Ms. McRae as being the first of our teachers who really treated us as adults, met us on our own terms, respected us. That counted for <i>so</i> much at that point in our lives. And the English stuff must have caught, too, as reading &amp; writing are what I love now.<br>\n<b><br></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>Janice Cooper (</b>not totally sure I have her first name right) taught senior Government &amp; Civics. She was super-challenging to me, and really encouraged me to work through what I thought. (Which, I have to say, must have been extremely trying on her patience, as I was an idiot. I still am, from time to time, but what she taught me about civic engagement &amp; independent thinking persists and mostly means I'm not too <i>big</i> an idiot.)<br>\n<b><br></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>Phil Campbell</b> taught me Physics I &amp; II, in 11th and 12th grade, at Mac, and of all the classes I've taken in my life, I think his was the subject matter that most engaged my full brain, that got me thinking the hardest and working the hardest to actually solve problems. I heard that he passed away a couple of years ago, and was sad to hear of it. I really, really liked those classes.<br>\n<b><br></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>Randy Thomson</b> was probably the single-most influential teacher of my school life. He taught Latin, which I took in 10th, 11th &amp; 12th grades, and sponsored the Latin club, in which we competed in something called Certamen -- I'd call it a sort of Jeopardy! for nerds, but that seems kinda redundant -- so let me just say that it's something we loved doing and practicing for and spending time on, and Mr. T, as we called him, was just always there for us, and always pushing, and encouraging, and teaching. I think he still teaches Latin now, at a different school in the same district, and it gives me great joy to think of all the people who have gotten to experience Latin and Rome with him.<br>\n<br>\n<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So that's it -- my list of school teachers who had the biggest impact on my life, 20-30 years later. This post doesn't do any of their work justice, but maybe it's something at least.<br>\nWho were your most influential teachers?<br></span></p>\n",

				"title": "Why I'm messing with fonts",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>If you come to the web-based version of my blog instead of reading it in a feed reader, and you use a modern browser -- Firefox and Safari, at least, and maybe some versions of Chrome -- you may have noticed I've been experimenting with using different fonts.</p>\n<p>I've been doing this for a couple of reasons, neither of which is particularly related to the readability and aesthetics of the blog.</p>\n<p>The first reason, and more important of the two, is that I wanted to experiment with the new <a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/beautiful-fonts-with-font-face/\">@font-face support</a> in <a href=\"http://getfirefox.com\">Firefox 3.5</a>. I have a strongly held point of view that you don't really learn about something until you do it -- and since I have a bit of an affinity to fonts, I thought I should try @font-face out on my own blog. I discovered a few different things in this process.</p>\n<p>First, there are not a lot of really good fonts online that are licensed for use on web sites -- either free &amp; open fonts or purchased fonts. I think both categories (free and non-free) will see more &amp; higher quality fonts available soon, since fonts are available now to so many more users than before. (@font-face was not new with Firefox, but obviously Firefox brings a lot of users along.)</p>\n<p>Second, you learn a lot about your web server &amp; how quick it can send data, since in addition to your web content now it's gotta send font files that are 50-100 KB or more. My server, for the record, totally sucked. Now it's better, but not as quick as I'd really like.</p>\n<p>Third, the differences in implementations really become apparent. Safari opts to wait until a font file is loaded before showing any text rendered in that font; Firefox renders the text in already-resident fonts and then sort of \"pops\" the text into the new font when it downloads. That shows pretty clearly a difference in aesthetic between WebKit and Gecko (and probably the organizations behind them): WebKit (and Apple) prefers a solution to minimize visual divergence -- so you never see text in the wrong font. Gecko (and Mozilla) prefers a solution to get people reading content as quickly as they can, even if it means a momentary rendering in sub-optimal font -- because a lot of times people want to get to their content as quickly as possible. Anyhow, different decisions that will impact designers and consumers differently.</p>\n<p>Finally, it helps us figure out where the bugs are. One of the initial fonts I used didn't have some ligatures implemented -- \"ff\" in particular -- and Firefox handled that by just not showing anything. :-)<br></p>\n<p>[As an aside, I've been tracking <a href=\"http://www.typekit.com\">TypeKit</a> since before they launched, and am quite optimistic about their prospects. I'll try them out as soon as they open up the beta.]<br></p>\n<p>The second reason I wanted to experiment is that I'm a bit of a font nerd. Have been since my mom got her first Mac in 1985. I really like type and lettering and the way that it affects how people feel and think. One of my favorite classes at Stanford was called \"Concepts of Text\" and taught by a type designer named Charles Bigelow -- among other things, we had a couple of classes about typesetters who were burned at the stake for typesetting heretical documents. Good times.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I like type, and am really excited by the prospect of more sophisticated typography coming to the web. And as much as I like Helvetica -- and I do! and you should, too, not to mention you should <a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2008/04/17/helvetica/\">go see the movie</a> -- I feel like on the web today there's a bit of a Tyranny of Helvetica -- it's somehow viewed as the most appropriate type for, you know, <i>everything.</i></p>\n<p>So I'm experimenting, and will probably do it more. Right now, I'm over-using (not to mention sort of mis-using) 2 fonts on this blog. I'm using <a href=\"http://www.fonts.info/info/press/free-fonts-for-font-face-embedding.htm\">Graublau Sans</a> for the headlines -- it's an free/open license font designed for larger display settings. And I'm using Spiekermann's newer font <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=axel+family\">Axel</a> for the body type -- it was really designed for very small type -- especially in cells in Excel spreadsheets, for example -- but I liked that it has many similarities with his <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=meta&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\">Meta</a> typeface, which happens to be the one we use for the \"Mozilla\" and \"Firefox\" and \"Thunderbird\" wordmarks -- but also had a relatively inexpensive (under $100 US) @font-face compatible license available for purchase from <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/\">FontShop</a>.</p>\n<p>If I have some time this week I'm going to try to make some of the more egregious readability problems I've caused...um, I guess I'll strive to make them <i>less</i> egregious. But we'll see.</p>\n<p>I do know that it's fun to experiment with type again.</p>\n",

It was barely a book for me, and I'm a bit of a nerd about Rome. The book starts at Marcus Aurelius and goes through 500 AD or so -- a time of massive Roman influence in the world, but also a time that saw that influence dissipate over time.</p>\n<p>It was such a giant empire, and such a time of flux, that the book often reads like a list of emperors and conflicts than like a narrative of the period -- made even more complex by the tendency to have at least 2 and often 4 \"legitimate\" emperors at any given time, not to mention challengers and usurpers.</p>\n<p>But there were a couple of interesting things that made the book worth it for me. First was a complete &amp; overwhelming rejection of the analogies between the fall of Rome and the fall of the United States. (I don't particularly have an opinion on whether US influence is fading, although I tend to agree with Zakaria that it's really more about the \"rise of the rest\" -- but I have long thought that the Roman Empire had essentially nothing in common with the \"American Empire.\")</p>\n<p>The second thing that I really liked is that the book helped me understand the split of the empire into a Western Empire (with a capital at Rome, later Milan, then Ravenna) and an Eastern Empire (with its capital of Constantinople), and how the East persisted long after the West fell. (It isn't a history of the Holy Roman Empire, fwiw -- it ends around 500 AD, so not that much of note had happened.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, glad I read it; not sure I'd recommend it to anyone who wasn't particularly interested in this stuff.</p>\n",

He's seen a lot, and had extremely good access to many of the people who are shaping the world, including VCs, scientists and leaders of Hezbollah.</p>\n<p>It's a book about the overwhelming complexity of today's world situation, and a repudiation of the control &amp; predictability orientation that has driven so much of our foreign affairs since (at least) post-World War II.</p>\n<p>I don't think that I agree with all of it, but the basic premise is sound: we cannot completely control our own destiny, and the world is too complex a place to attack every problem directly. We need to be smarter &amp; more agile &amp; more flexible, not to mention more willing to see that there are leaders who matter in every community, not just heads of state.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><span class=\"highlight\" id=\"AA33Q1DB09ZSK07DH0D7UIY0IQN1\">\"It isn’t easy to accept that the world is being shaped by forces you don’t understand and can’t agree with. It requires a willingness to master some of that strangeness instead of simply labeling it as “mad” or trashing it as “evil.” It means getting comfortable with the attitude that Niels Bohr once described as an inevitable part of a quantum view, that tickling “are you kidding me?” feeling as you try something a bit nuts only to discover that it works wonderfully. Building a bureaucracy that can do that, populating it with minds capable of such leaps, is going to require a heroic act of reimagination on our part. But, as I think you’ll see by the end of this book, there’s no reason to think we’re not capable of it.\"</span><br></p>\n</blockquote>\n",

I have a pretty strong sense that there's some pro-Shia bias in the book (although as an outsider, it's difficult to assess how much, really) -- nonetheless, this was probably the single most useful book I've read to understand the situation and possible new developments in the region.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1623453-john-lilly\">View all my reviews.</a>\n",

				"content_text": "As some of you know, I'm on the Board of Library Trustees for the City of Sunnyvale, where I live. Or at least I am for a few more weeks -- my 4 year term ends next month. I've really enjoyed my time on the Board -- I've contributed a little, learned a <em>lot </em>and generally was just more involved in civic government than I had been before. (I heartily recommend getting involved in the running of the city/county/state/country/place/community/neighborhood in which you live. It's important.)\n\nAnyway, I come to the end of my involvement as convinced as ever that public libraries are critically important to our lives as citizens, but also just as convinced that we'll see a massive reinvention in many of the functions that libraries perform.\n\nBut that isn't really what I want to write about today -- what I want to talk about instead is the budget work that's going on for the City of Sunnyvale in 2010 -- the topic of our Library Board meeting tonight.\n\nAt the end of last year, Sunnyvale hired a new city manager, Gary Luebbers, who inherited, like so many other city managers around the country, a government facing massive shortfalls in revenue among other problems. The preamble to his budgetary response for the coming year is fantastic work, and let's start with some of the context:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sunnyvale's overall budget for 09/10 is something like $150M (plus the costs for the water treatment facility and the golf course)</li>\n\t<li>We're expecting a decline in revenue of $13M, primarily due to a shortfall in sales tax -- people &amp; companies aren't buying things like routers and cars as much as they used to -- so we're seeing dramatic drops</li>\n\t<li>Beyond that, the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) has seen equity declines of around 25% this year, which is leading to increased employer contributions -- about $8.5M more in Sunnyvale personnel costs starting in 2011/12</li>\n</ul>\nSo we're seeing a 10% revenue shortfall and another 7-8% increase in costs -- not to mention that after the ballot initiatives failed earlier this week, there's an expectation that the State of California will borrow up to 8% of local property taxes (that they'll repay eventually, but has an impact of nearly $4M in near term cash flow).\n\nAny way you cut it, that's a brutal context for any city to deal with -- even a larger city of 100K+ residents like Sunnyvale -- between revenue shortfall &amp; increased expenditure, you're looking at $15-20M a year.\n\nBut here' the thing: Sunnyvale, while we'll see cuts, is basically okay because of the extremely conservative and long-range planning that it's done since reinvention in the 70s. We've got a $36M budget stabilization fund, for example -- and we can draw down on that for a few years -- and because of that, the cash flow interruption from the State doesn't matter overmuch.\n\nI have some concerns about the conservative nature of Sunnyvale city planning -- I think in any normal times it's over-constraining -- but in this particular situation, facing such a brutal and cascading financial meltdown, it's incredibly, incredibly helpful to have this strength, and is a reassuring bulwark against the effects of the broader economy.\n",

[I started writing this right away, anyway, but now am just getting around to finishing it.]</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Philip Johnson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was a complex guy, for sure. One of the leading architects of the Modernist movement, he&rsquo;s built some of the most influential buildings of the 20th century, from his own residence, the Glass House, to the Seagram Building in NYC, to the Crystal Cathedral. What I didn&rsquo;t know before is that he&rsquo;s known as much for the people he influenced and mentored &ndash; many of whom were probably better architects.</p>\n<p>Anyway, he built this house for himself called the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Glass House<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it&rsquo;s exactly what it sounds like &ndash; a house that he lived in for more than 50 years with walls made only of glass.</p>\n<p>Building a house that&rsquo;s completely transparent is more than just an architectural statement (and it definitely is a significant architectural statement) &ndash; it&rsquo;s also a personal statement &ndash; a statement of values, of ideals. It&rsquo;s made more interesting by Johnson himself &ndash; among other things, a gay man who had voiced support for Nazi Germany in the 30s (although he later clearly &amp; obviously regretted it and couldn&rsquo;t really even understand it). Think of that. To be a gay man (not openly, but more of an open secret) in mid-20th century America and deciding to build a house that anyone could see right into, and even through. There&rsquo;s a lot to parse in there by people who know a lot more about the human psyche than I do, but right off the bat you can see any number of ideas: idealism, design, openness, exhibitionism, power &ndash; it&rsquo;s a really complicated mix of things.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s made more complicated by the fact that the Glass House isn&rsquo;t really a glass house &ndash; or rather, that particular building is made of glass and transparent, but it&rsquo;s situated in a much larger context &ndash; 47 acres of extremely maintained landscape, and something like 19 total buildings that make up, really, a house turned inside out. And the Glass House itself is the only building made of any significant amount of glass. (with the exception of the ceiling of the sculpture museum)</p>\n<p>So there&rsquo;s the Glass House, with a living room, kitchen (although minimal &ndash; they called it more of a martini bar), dining area, bathroom (in the brick column), plus some walnut cabinets in the middle.

The point that Dorothy Dunn, our guide, made is that it&rsquo;s a great irony for an art collector to build a house where the walls are glass &ndash; no place to hang art! So they built this underground bunker sort of thing, and it can hold a LOT of art for the space &ndash; the works are on a sort of giant rolodex system, so you can rotate in whatever art you want to look at.

But it also reads like it could have been written in the last year or so, about what we're all experiencing with the incredible pace of change on the connected Internet. Postman's ability to see what the future had in store -- along with great minds like McLuhan -- is totally astounding. The first couple of chapters of this book, in particular, are of huge relevance to everyone working on the Web today. (Thanks to Jared Kopf for the recommendation &amp; book loan!)\n\nA couple of quotes for today from 40 years ago:\n<blockquote>Change occurs so rapidly that each of us in the course of our lives has continuously to work out a set of values, beliefs, and patterns of behavior that are viable, or seem viable, to each of us personally. And just when we have identified a workable system, it turns out to be irrelevant because so much has changed while we were doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>As the number of messages increases, the amount of information carried decreases. We have more media to communicate fewer significant ideas.</blockquote>\n<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1623453-john-lilly\">View all my reviews.</a>\n",

I've liked Robbins historically, and especially Skinny Legs and All and Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas (his 2 books in the 1990s), but haven't thought much of his work this decade.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Moving-Higher-Ground-Jazz-Change/dp/1400060788%3FSubscriptionId%3D0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2%26tag%3Dadriaantijsse-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1400060788\"><img src=\"https://johnolilly.micro.blog/uploads/2025/8a84ec2e49.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>I think this book will be of limited interest to most people -- but Marsalis has always been a bit of a hero of mine, ever since I started playing trumpet in middle school. I learned to love his playing primarily through his classical music -- his Hayden, Hummel &amp; L. Mozart recordings were a revelation to me, and I can still hear them in my head now, 25 years later.</p>\n<p>I saw his jazz ensemble play live in Dallas in the early 90s -- this tiny little club, and I was at a table about 10 feet away -- amazing. And then again at Stanford while I was there (and I talked with him for a bit because he had forgotten his mouthpiece -- I offered to run to get mine -- was the same 1C that he used -- but was too far away to be useful).</p>\n<p>Over the past decade or two his focus has been on jazz, of course, and his work at Lincoln Center has been a lot about helping Americans -- kids in particular -- understand the history and legacy of the music. He obviously cares deeply about both, and thinks there's much to gain from others understanding it.</p>\n<p>Marsalis is not known for being the best performer of jazz ever -- some of what he does is not quite as interesting as a lot of performers, today and historically. But I have great respect for the man and his craft and his sense of seriousness (and fun) in teaching others to understand it.</p>\n<p>So this was a fun book to read, because it's a bit of a survey of jazz, filtered through Marsalis' brain -- he knew a ton of the principals, has played with many. Here are a few fun quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The blues is a vaccine: It's the controlled dose of something bad that prepares someone to deal with the approaching uncontrollable bad.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Jazz teaches empathy -- you create and nurture a feeling with other people -- and it also teaches you to do your own thing. In our music, there are so many ways for people to find and express their individuality, no single set of rules could possibly apply.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"In music and in life, serious listening forces you to recognize others. Empathetic listeners almost always have more friends than other people, and their counsel is more highly valued. A patient, understanding listener lives in a larger world than a nonlistening know-it-all (no matter how charismatic). Jazz sharpens your hearing because you are following musicians' ideas and trying to hear the human depth of their sound.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...once the band begins to play, they know that for the next hour and fifteen minutes, everyone -- musicians and waitresses, the initiated and the unsuspecting -- will be united in the purest possible expression of community, having made the choice to become 'us' instead of 'me'.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And a funny story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I first met Dizzy [Gillespie] when I was about fifteen years old at a club called Rosie's on Tchoupitoulas Street in New Orleans. My dad said, \"This is my son. He plays trumpet.\"</p>\n\n  <p>Dizzy was standing near the dressing room doorway. He handed me his horn and said, 'Play me something, man.' He had a real small mouthpiece. I wasn't used to playing that -- <em>pooooot.</em> He didn't know what to say with my daddy standing there, so he said, 'Yeaaaah' -- really drawn out, as if the length of it could help ease the awkwardness of the moment. And then he leaned down close to me and said, 'Practice, motherfucker.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>:-)</p>\n<p>This was the first e-book on Kindle that I read where I really wanted music attached to the file so that I could listen to the music that he was talking about from Monk or Coltrain or Davis -- would really have enriched the experience a lot, and no reason that can't happen in the future.</p>\n",

And I'm incredibly happy that her voice exists. She's a total history nerd, making the world better by making some esoteric parts of our past a little more accessible.</p>\n<p>While I didn't love reading the book -- found it a bit of a slog -- there are passages in it that capture perfectly some of the ways that I feel about being an American in 2009, so I'll quote a few.</p>\n<p>First, some context:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I will say that the theological differences between the Puritans on the <em>Mayflower</em> and the Puritans on the <em>Arabella</em> are beyond small. Try negligible to the point of nitpicky. I will also say that reads who squirm at microscopic theological differences might be unsuited to read a a book about seventeenth-century Christians. Or, for that matter, a newspaper. Secular readers who marvel every morning at the death toll in the Middle East ticking ever higher due to, say, the seemingly trifling Sunni-versus-Shia rift in Islam, might look deep into their own hearts and identify their own semantic lines in the sand. For instance, a devotion to <em>The Godfather Part II</em> and equally intense disdain for <em>The Godfather Part III.</em> Someday they might find themselves at a bar and realize they are friends with a woman who can't tell any of the <em>Godfather</em> movies apart and asks if <em>Part II</em> was the one that had 'that guy in the boat.' Them's fightin' words, right?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And a little personal reflection, a clear sign of the times in which the book was written:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Honestly, I wish I weren't so moved by this Puritan quandary. I wish I did not identify with their essential questions: What if my country is destroying itself? Could I leave? Should I? And if so, what time's the next train to Montreal?</p>\n\n  <p>Well, maybe not Montreal. The first reason Winthrop's pros-and-cons tract gives for crossing the Atlantic is to build a Protestant New England as an antidote to Catholic New France, to 'raise a bulwark against the kingdom of Antichrist, which the Jesuits labor to rear up in those parts.' Antichrist, by the way, is another name they call the pope.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then she mentions a sentence from one of Winthrop's speeches the she calls \"one of the most beautiful sentences in the English language:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We must delight in each other, make other's conditions our own, rejoice together, mourn together, labor and suffer together, always having before our eyes our commission and community in the work, our community as members of the same body.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She's right, and that's one of the things I really like about Vowell: she notices the noble sentiments that were so often obscured by the less noble contexts of our founding.</p>\n<p>And now a series of quotes that are a little longish, but the central contemporary point of the book for me. It's in the context of watching Ronald Reagan's 2004 funeral in the National Cathedral. Many of the eulogists evoked Reagan's \"city on a hill\" imagery, and quoted Winthrop at length, and in particular she notes Sandra Day O'Connor's speech, where she quotes a line \"...the eyes of all people are upon us so that if we shall deal falsely...we shall be made a story and a byword through the world.\"</p>\n<p>And Vowell writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"At that moment, there was one story known through the world, a byword on everyone's lips: Abu Ghraib. A couple of weeks before O'Connor said that last line, I went to New York University to hear a speech given by one of the people sitting in the National Cathedral -- former vice president Al Gore - demanding that another person sitting there -- Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld -- resign because of the revelation that American Military Police officers had tortured, raped, and killed Iraqi prisoners at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib penitentiary.</p>\n\n  <p>Everyone in the cathedral, everyone watching on television, hearing O'Connor's voice, had seen the appalling photos...</p>\n\n  <p>In his NYU speech, Gore...even implied that these crimes against Iraqi prisoners of war were an offense not just to us, right now, but to our Puritan forebears: 'What a terrible irony that our country, which was founded by refugees seeking religious freedom -- coming to America to escape domineering leaders who tried to get them to renounce their religion -- would now be responsible for this kind of abuse.\"...</p>\n\n  <p>Gore used the argument of American exceptionalism (first set forth by John Cotton and John Winthrop and their comrades) to bemoan this betrayal of American exceptionalism -- how we as a people 'consistently choose good over evil in our collective aspirations more than the people of any other nation,' how Lincoln, early on in the Civil War, called for saving the Union because it was the 'last best hope of earth.'</p>\n\n  <p>That was the speech in which Lincoln pointed out 'we cannot escape history.' Well, we can't. I can't really fault Gore for saying that what happened at Abu Ghraib is sickening, not only because it's just plain sickening but because America is supposed to be better than that. No: best. I hate to admit it, but I still believe that, too. Because even though my head tells me that the idea that America was chosen by God as His righteous city on a hill is ridiculous, my heart still buys into it. And I don't even believe in God! And I have heard the screams! Why is America the last best hope of Earth? What if it's Liechtenstein? Or, worse, Canada?</p>\n\n  <p>...</p>\n\n  <p><em>The eyes of all people are upon us.</em> And all they see is a mash-up of naked prisoners and an American girl in fatigues standing there giving a thumbs-up. As I write this, the United States of America is still a city on a hill; and it's still shining -- because we never turn off the lights in our torture prisons. That's how we carry out the sleep deprivation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Very serious thoughts, simultaneously sophisticated, knowing the truth, and childish, wanting &amp; needing America to set the example, to be the example that it can be. In truth, that's where I am, too. With my head, I know that the country has come to a perilous point, wish it weren't true, and am hopeful that we can pull ourselves together and become great again, like so many other times in our history.</p>\n<p>Vowell ends the book with John F. Kennedy, as he contemplated the beginning of his presidency, and, wouldn't you know it, he also invokes Winthrop's city on a hill.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"'I have been guided by the standard John Winthrop set before his shipmates on the flagship <em>Arabella</em> three hundred and thirty-one years ago, as they, too, faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier,' Kennedy says.</p>\n\n  <p>Then he boils down the two phrases from [Winthrop's] \"A Model of Christian Charity\" that mean the most to him: 'We must always consider, [Winthrop] said, that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.'</p>\n\n  <p>I fall for those words every time I hear them, even though they're dangerous, even though they're arrogant, even though they're rude.</p>\n\n  <p>...</p>\n\n  <p>'Today the eyes of all people are truly upon us,\" Kennedy points out. He does not mention that the whole world is starting in America's direction because we have a lot of giant scary bombs, but I am guessing that is partly what he meant. He says that he hops that all branches of government, from the top on down, are mindful of 'their great responsibilities.' Responsibilities that include trying not to use the giant scary bombs.</p>\n\n  <p>...</p>\n\n  <p>He does not sound entirely steady. 'I ask for your help and your prayers, as I embark on this new and solemn journey,' he pleads. At this grave moment, he is not a man merely talking about the <em>Arabella.</em> He is on the dock in Southampton, ready to board the <em>Arabella,</em> along with the people before him. The mood is ominous and the fear is real. But this is a new beginning and he is not alone.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So those bits are worth the price of admission right there, and why I keep coming back to reading Sarah Vowell's banter about somewhat humorless people who lived centuries ago. Because in her words I find hope, certainly, empathy of views for sure, and people whose actions and words we can all aspire to.</p>\n",

Finally finished it this weekend, and liked it enough to read more of his books, although not right away. This book is in an interesting context, with an unusual narrative structure that's pretty disorienting to start with, but in hindsight makes a ton of sense. Banks' work is mostly set in the same context -- they're all called \"A Culture Novel,\" where the Culture is a group of, you know, thingys. So not my favorite ever, but I enjoyed this one well enough to try to understand Banks a little bit more.</p>\n",

I'm generally in favor of universal health care, don't mind paying higher taxes, and think the overall focus on energy, education &amp; health is right on. But the size of the deficits and the accumulated debt do worry me a lot.]</p>\n<p>Anyway, what I liked about this book, written before Obama was actually elected, is that Kuttner goes through some presidents that didn't just triangulate public opinion, but changed the nature of the US, the way we talked and thought about our obligations. Here are a few good quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"As Doris Kearns Goodwin observes, all of the great presidents used their leadership first to transform the public understanding of national challenges and then to break through impasses made up of congressional blockage, interest-group power, voter cynicism or passivity, and conventional wisdom. In different ways, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson found allies, respectively, in the abolitionist movement, the labor movement, and the civil rights movement, as well as the press and the general public. Each president grew immensely in office. Each changed the national mood, then the direction of national policy.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that, in a nutshell, is the challenge for Obama. Said another way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Obama will need to be a more radical president than he was a presidential candidate. Radical does not mean outside the mainstream. It means perceiving, as a leader, that radical change is necessary, discerning tacit aspirations and unmet needs in the people, and then making that radical change the mainstream view for which people clamor.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There will be lots of debate, questioning, and argument about where the US should go -- that's good &amp; right, and should happen. That it happen in a transparent &amp; open way is crucial, and I think that that's happening, irrespective of any particular policies in the first 60 days.</p>\n<p>But a long way to go, so we'll see what happens -- in any event, this book helped me think through the challenge of leading from the Oval Office, and the opportunity as well.</p>\n",

But for whatever reason, I've had a hard time getting through it. I didn't find the subject matter as personally compelling as Kidder's seminal work, <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine\">The Soul of a New Machine</a></em> (which I've read several times and is a very important book -- sort of a proto-<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs\">Microserfs</a></em> :-)).</p>\n<p>I think I found the writing on this one a little flat, and the story a little repetitious.</p>\n<p>But I have to say that the man, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_farmer\">Paul Farmer</a>, is incredible and inspirational and amazing. Obviously a hero of the highest order, and someone who decided to change the world and did, in a very positive way. His work has centered in (especially) Haiti, Peru &amp; Russia -- work dedicated to improving the health of the poor -- in particular tuberculosis and AIDS. He's done great, thoughtful indefatigable work, and this is a story that everyone should know and cheer.</p>\n",

So I was a little disappointed that this, the 2nd book, wouldn't be published here in the US until summer of this year.</p>\n<p>But happily, the UK edition came out in January, and I happened to be going through Heathrow, so picked it up. (And proceeded to carry the 600 page giant airport edition bookstop through 4 countries before getting it home. :-)</p>\n<p>The verdict, for me, is that this is a solid offering that gives a ton of backstory into the protagonists, but isn't nearly as fun as the first book, which was much tighter, although really slow at the end. This book, by contrast, was sort of all over the place for the first 200 pages or so, then turned into a well-paced thriller for the last 400, but not as fun a mystery, really (and not that hard to figure out).</p>\n<p>But worth reading, and I'll pick up the 3rd book when the English-language translation comes out in a year or so.</p>\n<p>(Let me know if anyone in the States wants to borrow my UK copy!)</p>\n",

It's a neat activity, and changing the way that my interactions work throughout my life, really.</p>\n",

In particular, I find that I follow and read Obama's <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing_room/executive_orders/\">Executive Orders and Presidential Memoranda</a> every day or two.\n\nThe fact that they're available (and easy to find) along with a lot of other information on whitehouse.gov is fantastic and incredibly meaningful. But the content is also incredible so far, and in particular one specific memo titled \"<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/FreedomofInformationAct/\">Freedom of Information Act</a>\".\n\nIt is a beautiful and clear piece of writing, and states some incredibly important principles of operation and standards of behavior that I hope our agencies can live up to. The memo speaks for itself, so I'll quote several passages at some length.\n<blockquote>\"A democracy requires accountability, and accountability requires transparency. As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, \"sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.\" In our democracy, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which encourages accountability through transparency, is the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring an open Government. At the heart of that commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the Government and the citizenry alike.\"</blockquote>\n<strong>And the absolute most important line:</strong><em> \"The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails.\"</em>\n\nThis could not be clearer, and is a monumental step. And then he pushes everyone to go further than they're required by law:\n<blockquote>\"All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher in a new era of open Government.  The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA.\n<div>The presumption of disclosure also means that agencies should take affirmative steps to make information public. They should not wait for specific requests from the public. All agencies should use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government. Disclosure should be timely.\"</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>Really, I couldn't be prouder of our government for this, or more hopeful.</div>\n",

Lee and also people who came over on the Mayflower.</li>\n\t<li>My dad was in the US Air Force growing up, and so I've lived in many different places, but all in the US. I was born in Sacramento, CA, then: Fort Walton Beach, FL, St. Simon's Island, GA, Rome, NY, Omaha, NE, Las Vegas, NV, and went to high school in San Antonio, TX. I've lived in my current house probably longer than anywhere else in my life. (5 years)</li>\n\t<li>I was a band geek. And a Latin geek. And a math geek. Competed in all of them in school, at state &amp; national levels. For all the stereotypes, I  look back on all those experiences with exceptional fondness, and they were all foundational to me. Oh, also, <a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2007/03/29/not-exactly-the-kaos-computer-club/\">computer geek</a>.</li>\n\t<li>I met my wife, Kathy, my freshman year in high school (1984), when we dated on &amp; off (and in band, as it turns out). We got back together 10 years later, and then married in 2000. By total coincidence, her mother and my mother were in the same sorority at Emory at the same time and knew each other. (Dad was at Emory also.)</li>\n\t<li>I really like television a lot. A LOT. <em>The Wire </em>is my favorite, and I really miss <em>Arrested Development </em>(although <em>30 Rock </em>has its moments)<em>. </em>And <em>Buffy, </em>a lot<em>. </em>But to tell you the truth, and I know this will be disillisioning to many of you, I'm starting to lose my taste for it, and often lately can't even find anything to watch. Impossible, and very sad, I know. [\"Teacher, mother, secret lover.\" -- name the quote!]</li>\n\t<li>The job I held the longest in high school was as a short-order cook at a Chinese fast food restaurant called Qwik Wok. I was pretty marginal at that, but can cook a LOT of fried rice at once. One time I took an egg roll because I was really hungry. Got busted. I'm like the opposite of sneaky.</li>\n\t<li>My favorite movie of all times, without reservation, is <em>Bull Durham</em>. I can't escape it when it's on.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol></ol>\n<strong>My Tagees (I'm terribly sorry)</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<a href=\"http://blog.adamnash.com/\">Adam</a>, because he needs something that's not just BSG to write about this week.</li>\n\t<li>\n<a href=\"http://metacool.typepad.com/\">Diego</a>, because he's awesome, is writing more lately, and I bet will have something gnarly to say.</li>\n\t<li>\n<a href=\"http://bobsutton.typepad.com/\">Bob</a>, because I'm interested to see whether he'll do it or not, and what he'll say.</li>\n\t<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.scottkleper.com/wordpress/\">Klep</a>, because he's funny as hell and should write more.</li>\n\t<li>\n<a href=\"http://blog.kapor.com\">Mitch</a>, since he's been so interesting on Twitter lately.

But they're fun, very readable, and fit like a comfortable sweater -- great for when you're sick.</p>\n<p>(I actually like the next book in the series, <em>The Naked Sun</em>, a little better -- it's a particularly unusual take on a locked room mystery, and very memorable.)</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>A few quick thoughts on my Kindle now that I've lived with it for a year. I've purchased 46 books on it, reading at least some of each of them, and finishing about half.</p>\n<p>1. The integrated wireless store is absolutely the best part of it. I can literally think of a book and have it available to read within a minute.</p>\n<p>2. Selection of titles is getting better, but still only about 50% of what I read.</p>\n<p>3. Reading on it seems no different on my eyes than reading on paper -- paperback pulp is probably the closest contrast-wise.</p>\n<p>4. I find that books do seem longer on the Kindle, mostly because I get a little lost in terms of where I am. The indicators are all good, but it's hard to figure out how close we are to chapter endings, etc. As a result, it's screwing with all my 38 year old physical book navigating abilities.</p>\n<p>5. It's making book reading much less social for me, because nobody can tell what I'm reading. On airplanes, that's a great thing. So great. At home with my wife, it's not as good, because it means we don't have as many serendipitous conversations initiated by her about what I'm reading. [A weird side effect was that I was trying to get through the last 50 pages of a mystery over break -- usually people can tell where you are in a book and that you're near the end, and will forgive anti-social behavior if you're sprinting to the end -- with a Kindle, they think I'm even less social than I generally am.]</p>\n<p>Overall, though, my sentiment is the same that everyone else who has one has: it's a very flawed device, and I would never give it up at this point.</p>\n",

Well-written, of course, but doesn't hang together quite as well a Tipping Point. Maybe 3 lessons stand out:</p>\n<p>1. Timing matters. The time in which you live has much to do with whether you're successful or not -- basically, the conditions have to be right for your field.</p>\n<p>2. Hard work &amp; practice time matters more than raw talent. He (and others) estimate that it takes about 10,000 hours of practice to become a master at something.</p>\n<p>3. Your culture &amp; history matter. He's arguing that there are certain things about <em>how</em> you think that come from your upbringing, your parents', their parents', and so on.</p>\n<p>I think none of this stuff is particularly earth-shattering, but still good to remember. One bit that I found interesting is when he talked about the regularity of Asian numbering systems (essentially one, two, three...ten-one, ten-two, ten-three...three-tens-one, three-tens-two, three-tens-three, and so on) compared to English (one, two, three...eleven, twelve, thirteen...thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three). The idea is that basic arithmetic makes more sense in a more regular language -- and we've found that to absolutely be the case with our son, who's 3 now, and can count &amp; think much better in Mandarin about numbers than in English, even though his overall English skills are much better. Gladwell's point is that things like this can/will have lasting implications for large populations.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you like Gladwell, you've no doubt already got the book; if not, it's worth picking up once you read <em>The Tipping Point,</em> which is much more distinctive and important.</p>\n",

Books about narrow subcultures are among my favorites, and this was a great one. Fun to read, and lots about both the historical and current culture of pigeon-lovers that I had no idea at all about.</p>\n<p>My favorite part, although by no means exactly the most animal-friendly, was the bit about the Parlor Rollers -- pigeons who, when placed upon the ground, \"...somersault backward like deranged, feathered gymnasts.\" Not just a short way, either -- but up to a couple of football fields long. Amazing. Results in paragraphs like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Paul's a bit disappointed with his bird's roll. It stops at 122 feet and 9 inches. \"I just don't think he had that many rolls in him today,\" he confesses. Nonetheless, the high level of competition at the Grand Nationals invigorates Paul. \"If I could have a competitive roll like this every week,\" he says, \"I'd be in heaven.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And I guess I should note here that pigeons are among SPL's favorite subject matter now, too.

This book won't be surprising to anyone who is involved in the Internet -- it's relatively surface level.

Anything he writes, I'll pick up -- he's just a very careful and thoughtful historian who's able to contextualize a great number of contemporary world events and help you make sense of the real history.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is a bit of an unusual book -- it chronicles the life of Joseph Needham, a Cambridge scientist who became enamored with China and it's amazing history of scientific innovation (especially from antiquity to the 1500s or so). He was right to be fascinated, of course -- the Chinese invented printing, gunpowder, chain link, the segmented arch bridge, and on and on. He learned about all this as a British diplomat during and after WWII. Then later in life, back at Cambridge, put together a colossus of a history called <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Science-Civilisation-China-Introductory-Orientations/dp/052105799X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1230167619&amp;sr=1-2\">Science and Civilization in China</a>.</em> Weighing in at 7 gigantic volumes, it's never been out of print since its introduction (of volume 1) in 1956.</p>\n<p>The book also details a bunch of Needham's adventurous (escaping parts of China just before the Japanese occupation forces closed the roads, for example), peculiar (a confirmed nudist, clearly polyamorous, etc), and and controversial (blacklisted as a communist by McCarthy, duped by Mao's government into condemning the US for alleged (and apparently false) claims of using biological weapons during the Korean war) paths through life.</p>\n<p>I didn't love this book -- it was a little too long for so narrow a look -- but am glad that I read it. Would recommend his other books first. But I'll pick up his next book, for sure, no matter what the topic is.</p>\n",

He's written several exceptional books, and has made some important themes very accessible to millions of people. He gets criticized by a lot of people for a lot of things, but I think quite highly of the man, his insights, and his ability to help people understand some of the more fundamental things that are happening in our world. I've seen a bunch of what he writes about firsthand in some of my travels around the world the last few years, and think he's probably as good as anyone at synthesizing things to bring home (Zakaria is another like this.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, this book is about energy -- or, rather, the impact of the way that we predominantly get our energy -- on the climate around us. It felt on the long side to me -- I think there was a little too much anecdotal reporting and the book could have been edited down -- but it's probably the most comprehensive + accessible look at climate change and the impacts on modern life that I've read so far.

I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could make it at all, and ended up walking some in the last mile &ndash; otherwise I think I could have done right around 1:48, or maybe better. While I didn&rsquo;t find the physical grind type of race as fun to do, I am immensely proud of it &ndash; really, truly, I was having trouble walking the days leading up to the race, and I just wasn&rsquo;t at all sure I could get the first mile done.

Second, as I started to slow down around 8 miles, people started to pass me, and I think that was damaging to my psyche &amp; motivation.

He's someone that I'm excited to watch and learn from and follow. As much as anything, I was struck by the inclusiveness of tone in the book, and the recognition that politics has fundamental structural issues. Anyway, now that he's President-Elect, I recommend that everyone read this book. I'm also very heartened by how his administration looks to be shaping up -- it's a smart, talented group of people who are marked by centrism and pragmatism -- in a time that we all need to work together to find a new way. And the situation with Lieberman and Clinton both seem to me to indicate that Obama is truly interested in governing as an American, not as a Democrat or a Liberal or a Chicagoan or anything else.</p>\n<p>Anyway, he's significantly more articulate than I am, so I'll let his words speak for themselves. There's a fair amount of interesting stuff in this book, so apologies for the long quoting. I really do think it's worth reading the book.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>More than anything, it is that sense -- that despite great differences in wealth, we rise and fall together -- that we can't afford to lose. As the pace of change accelerates, with some rising and many following, that sense of common kinship becomes harder to maintain. Jefferson was not entirely wrong to fear Hamilton's vision for the country, for we have always been in a constant balancing act between self-interest and community, markets and democracy, the concentration of wealth and power and the opening up of opportunity. We've lost that balance in Washington, I think. With all of us scrambling to raise money for campaigns, with unions weakened and press distracted and lobbyists for the powerful pressing their full advantage, there are few countervailing voices to remind us of who we are and where we've come from, and to affirm our bonds with one another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And this, that shows a recognition that there are real reasons for the antagonism and anger in the world, and in our country:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The growing threat, then, comes primarily from those parts of the world on the margins of the global economy where the international \"rules of the road\" have not taken hold -- the realm of weak or failing states, arbitrary rule, corruption, and chronic violence; lands in which an overwhelming majority of the population is poor, uneducated, and cut off from the global information grid; places where the rulers fear globalization will loosen their hold on power, undermine traditional cultures, or displace indigenous institutions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reading it, you also get the sense that Obama understands and is close to what it means to be a family in modern America, how complicated the decisions we make every day are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was only upon reflection, after the trials of those years had passed and the kids had started school, that I began to appreciate what Michelle had been going through at the time, the struggles so typical of today's working mother. For no matter how liberated I lied to see myself as -- no matter how much I told myself that Michelle and I were equal partners, and that her dreams and ambitions were as important as my own -- the fact was that when children showed up, it was Michelle and not I who was expected to make the necessary adjustments. Sure, I helped ,but it was always on my terms, on my schedule. Meanwhile, she was the one who had to put her career on hold. She was the one who had to make sure that the kids were fed and bathed every night. If Malia or Sasha got sick or the babysitter failed to show up, it was she who, more often than not, had to get on the phone to cancel a meeting at work. It wasn't just the constant scrambling between her work and the children that made Michelle's situation so tough. It was also the fact that from her perspective she wasn't doing either job well. This was not true, of course; her employers loved her, and everyone remarked on what a good mother she was. But I came to see that in her own mind, two visions of herself were at war with each other -- the desire to be the woman her mother had been, solid, dependable, making a home and always there for her kids; and the desire to excel in her profession, to make her mark on the world and realize all those plans she'd had on the very first day that we met...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, as I've said before, I'm tremendously optimistic about the man that we've elected president, and the administration that is forming now. As much as anything, I mostly think that we have a good person, who's not afraid to be smart and put smart people around him, in the right place to do a lot of good for our country and the world.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Along with (I think), thousands of Stanford alums, yesterday in my in box I found an extraordinary letter from John Hennessy, Stanford's President (and a wonderful CS professor and entrepreneur) about the current economic situation and the implications for Stanford. The letter speaks for itself, I think, but I'll preface it by noting a few things. First, John's proactive &amp; candid openness is incredible and wonderful to me. Happily, there seems to be a <a href=\"http://www.change.gov\">lot of that going around lately</a>. Second, the economic situation is very bad, expanding, and touching everyone. It's going to get much worse.\n\nStill, I can't help but feel like we're all developing ways to talk about challenges like a community of adults, whether they be in commercial terms like we have at Mozilla, in the academy like this note, or in our government with the new administration.

Anyway, the quick summary is that this is an incredibly important book, with an extremely important concept in it: generativity. It's the idea that systems that are open, have standard interfaces, and are not controlled by single parties (or small groups of them) are generative -- they tend to result in high degrees of innovation. Further, that the Internet is a very special case where it's open in the right ways, on the right levels, with the right interfaces -- and it's been unprecedented in delivering innovation &amp; user-centered designs to normal people. And, more than that, that there are some signals in the world that we're heading in bad directions -- we tend to gravitate towards closed, tethered systems -- like the iPhone, Tivo or Kindle (all of which I myself own and use).</p>\n<p>I've got lots more thought about this &amp; technology life cycles, but the bottom line on JZ's book is that everyone who's trying to work on the Web and build something great should read it.</p>\n",

A great analysis of what's happening in the world, not from the point of view of decline of the US, but of a rising of new participants. Can't recommend it highly enough. A couple of fantastic bits:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is a book not about the decline of America but rather about the rise of everyone else. It is about the great transformation taking place around the world, a transformation that, though often being discussed, remains poorly understood. This is natural. Changes, even sea changes, take place gradually. Though we talk about a new era, the world seems to be one with which we are familiar. But in fact, it is very different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, America's leading scholar-senator, once said, \"The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.\" That gets it just about right. Culture is important, terribly important. But it can change. Cultures are complex. At any given moment, certain attributes are prominent and seem immutable. And then politics and economics shift, and those attributes wane in importance, making space for others. The Arab world was once the center of science and trade. In recent decades, its chief exports have been oil and Islamic fundamentalism. Any cultural argument must be able to explain both periods of success and periods of failure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Smart, thought-provoking book that everyone should read.</p>\n",

Rather, I believe our adherence to a set of principles and practices for managing creative talent and risk is responsible. Pixar is a community in the true sense of the word. We think that lasting relationships matter, and we share some basic beliefs: Talent is rare. Management’s job is not to prevent risk but to build the capability to recover when failures occur. It must be safe to tell the truth.

The impact is profound: you get a sense of some of the real-time feelings &amp; thoughts &amp; perspectives that are happening around the world, not mediated through our traditional media or governmental channels.\n\nThe last couple of years I've been lucky to do some traveling for Mozilla -- in particular to China, Japan, and Europe -- and have found my perspective on what the world looks like (and can/should look like) changing greatly. (And I'm currently in the middle of Fareed Zakaria's excellent new book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Post-American-World-Fareed-Zakaria/dp/039306235X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1215536250&amp;sr=8-1\">The Post-American World</a> on this subject.)\n\nI'm just repeatedly blown away (and sometimes overwhelmed) by what Global Voices is doing -- it seems to me a necessary point of view in a world where national boundaries seem more &amp; more artificial and sometimes obstructive to the way people are having conversations and getting things done.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Another good &amp; full trip to Tokyo -- just got on the Narita Express -- and I have to say that Tokyo trains are an absolute marvel. I bought my ticket at 2 minutes to 2p, with the train set to board at 2:03, and made it all the way through a very complex Tokyo Station to get to the train with a minute or 2 to spare -- and of course the train left precisely on time.</p>\n<p>Over the past couple of years of coming here, I've really come to appreciate Tokyo as a city -- it never really feels super-dense anywhere even though there are lots of people living in a close space -- and there are lots of green areas, sidewalks, public transportation, on and on. When you consider that it's an absolutely gigantic city with maybe 28 million souls, the way that it works and feels is a stunning accomplishment.</p>\n<p>The past couple of mornings I've gotten up early to jog 10k or so from my hotel and around the Imperial Palace, and it's been great. Or, rather, yesterday was a good run, but not all that great, since it was rainy &amp; cold and I was jetlagged. Today was much nicer, and felt great to run around a place that's been important (and beautiful) for centuries. I'm starting to really like running in the early morning in urban areas like this (although I don't do it too often, and Sunnyvale isn't quite dense enough to be interesting) -- it's a bit of a communion with other runners -- a shared start to each of our disparate days.</p>\n<p>I found today &amp; yesterday that it really helped my running, too, as there was always someone ahead of me on the loop around the Palace -- so I always had someone to work to catch up to (and occasionally fall behind). As a result, I think I (re?)discovered something about myself: I tend to run better from behind. It's easier for me to concentrate and focus enough to catch up, and it makes me a better runner. (Or at least a more consistent, faster runner.) That's probably a little window into my non-running psyche, too, and maybe a clue to why I'm drawn to work at a place like Mozilla.<br></p>\n<p>Or maybe not; I'm a little jetlagged for psychoanalysis. On to Narita, then heading home. Thanks to everyone at Mozilla Japan for another very good trip, and for an unbelievably great launch here in Japan. See you in Vancouver.</p>\n",

[It isn't quite out in stores yet -- I think it comes out the end of July, but I got to read a galley.]</p>\n<p>I hadn't known that Murakami runs marathons -- he's in his 50s now and started when he was in his 30s. This book is a set of reflections on his running, and his writing, of course, since the disciplines have overlaps. The book really connected with me, even though I haven't worked my way up to full marathons yet (did a half last year, and will do another this year, but would like to do a full in the next year or 2), and it inspired me on several levels.</p>\n<p>So many good pieces of thoughtful writing here, I'm just going to quote a bunch. Like this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No matter how much long-distance running might suit me, of course there are days when I feel kind of lethargic and don't want to run. Actually, it happens a lot. On days like that, I try to think of all kinds of plausible excuses to slough it off. Once, I interviewed the Olympic running Toshihiko Seko, just after he retired from running and became manager of the S&amp;B company team. I asked him, \"Does a runner at your level ever feel like you'd rather not run today, like you don't want to run and would rather just sleep in?\" He stared at me and then, in a voice that made it abundantly clear how stupid he thought the question was, replied, \"Of course. All the time!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the past month or so, I've been trying to run each morning before everyone wakes up -- I feel like I've found a whole extra hour in the day, and it's been really helpful to me. But I feel, very often, like I don't want to get up and run. Working on it. Maybe it's something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...I'm happy I haven't stopped running all these years. The reason is, I like the novels I've written. And I'm really looking forward to seeing what kind of novel I'll produce next. Since I'm a writer with limits -- an imperfect person living an imperfect, limited life -- the fact that I can still feel this way is a real accomplishment. Calling it a miracle might be an exaggeration, but I really do feel this way. And if running every day helps me accomplish this, then I'm very grateful to running.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And I do find that I'm learning things about myself by doing it, and developing the discipline:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It doesn't matter how old I get, but as long as I continue to live I'll always discover something new about myself. No matter how long you stand there examining yourself naked before a mirror, you'll never see reflected what's inside.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the real reflection, the real lesson, is here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My time, the rank I attain, my outward appearance -- all of these are secondary. For a runner like me, what's really important is reaching the goal I set myself, under my own power. I give it everything I have, endure what needs enduring, and am able, in my own way, to be satisfied. From out of the failures and joys I always try to come away having grasped a concrete lesson. (It's got to be concrete, no matter how small it is.) And I hope that, over time, as one race follows another, in the end I'll reach a place I'm content with. Or maybe just catch a glimpse of it. (Yes, that's a more appropriate way of putting it.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's it, the whole essence, really. By doing something deliberate like running, with your own set of goals and successes and setbacks -- your own sense of what &amp; who you're trying to be -- that lets you sometimes catch a glimpse of the person you might be content with. It's a Catch-22, I think: that by the very striving to do something, to be something, that you can see/feel what it might be like to achieve it.</p>\n<p>I find that for myself I spend a lot of time working on how to be better at what I do (and probably not enough on how to get my running better, but I'm working on that, too), and am never really content with the way things are -- and I think that if I were somehow suddenly content that I wouldn't quite be me anymore. But I'm starting to notice things that are really meaningful to me lately that are about as good as it gets. In my running, increasingly, and of course in the myriad moments of life with my family (just playing whiffle ball with Kathy &amp; SPL last night was about perfect).</p>\n<p>So I'm inspired by the book, and by Murakami himself. Great book, worth reading more than once.</p>\n",

(The user interface to this, however, is really, really painful and not very useful. Hopefully they'll work on it, not to mention make it easy to use my Kindle to blog passages when I mark them as interesting.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I blogged a while about the posthumous Kurt Vonnegut collection called <em><a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2008/06/02/armageddon-in-retrospect-by-kurt-vonnegut/\">Armageddon in Retrospect</a></em> -- a reasonably good collection of some of his writing. But I forgot to share a few particularly good paragraphs from the introduction, written by his son Mark. Listen:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He taught how stories were told and taught readers how to read. His writings will continue to do that for a long time. He was and is subversive, but not the way people thought he was. He was the least wild-and-crazy guy I ever knew. No drugs. No fast cars.</p>\n\n  <p>He tried always to be on the side of the angels. He didn't think the war in Iraq was going to happen, right up until it did. It broke his heart not because he gave a damn about Iraq but because he loved America and believed that the land and people of Lincoln and Twain would find a way to be right. He believed, like his immigrant forefathers, that America could be a beacon and a paradise.</p>\n\n  <p>He couldn't help thinking that all that money we were spending blowing up things and killing people so far away, making people the world over hate and fear us, would have been better spent on public education and libraries. It's hard to image that history won't prove him right, if it hasn't already.</p>\n\n  <p>Reading and writing are in themselves subversive acts. What they subvert is the notion that things have to be the way they are, that you are alone, that no one has ever felt the way you have. What occurs to people when they read Kurt is that things are much more up for grabs than they thought they were. The world is a slightly different place just because they read a damn book. Imagine that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's about as good an elegy as you'll ever read.</p>\n",

But in a mostly good way. I didn't totally like the writing in this one -- found it a bit stiff -- but the subject is one that I've been thinking about a lot: how we grow up and age, how we get from being born to old age and eventually dying. I think the reason that Shields wrote this was to reflect on his relationship with his father, as his father gets older (in his late nineties as of the writing, and still apparently going strong). The book is structured as an intertwining of 2 trains of thoughts: (1) memories of his relationship with his father, and (2) mostly physiological descriptions of what happens to our bodies at various stages of our lives. A good book, and thought-provoking, but not the most engaging thing I've read lately.</p>\n",

It's tough to get through -- brutal characters and plot, and very tough prose. But it's a singular achievement -- and it's growing on me the further I get away from it. Not a happy or redeeming book in any way, really. But beautifully written, for sure. Not sure I've ever read a book quite like it. You can open to just about any page at random and be completely blown away by the writing.</p>\n<p>One of the most thematic passages of the book, when The Kid (the main character) is talking with and old man, who says (punctuation is all McCarthy's):</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The way of the transgressor is hard. God made this world, but he didn't make it to suit everybody, did he?... A man's at odds to know his mind cause his mind is aught he has to know it with. He can know his heart, but he dont want to. Rightly so. Best not to look in there. It aint the heart of a creature that is bound in the way that God has set for it. You can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make the machine. And evil that can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it....\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and a particularly relevant bit from The Judge (not a nice guy) towards the end:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"As war becomes dishonored and it's nobility called into question those honorable men who recognize the sanctity of blood will become excluded from the dance, which is the warrior's right, and thereby will the dance become a false dance and the dancers false dancers. And yet there will be one there always who is a true dancer... There is room on the stage for one beast and one alone. All others are destined for a night that is eternal and without name. One by one they will step down into the darkness before the footlamps. Bears that dance, bears that don't.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A rough book on violence and war and the measure of the meanest bits of the human soul. Not for everyone, but fantastic.</p>\n",

But both guys are really important pitchers.</p>\n",

He says that we should address the real impact of global warming, but shouldn't do it at all costs; shouldn't automatically prioritize it to the top because it's got such a focus of attention of consumers &amp; politicians. Anyway, I like this type of discussion and analysis much better than I like the way we're talking about global warming at present.

A Mark Twain for the 2nd half of the 20th century, he's always had a clear, crisp voice that was unafraid to use the absurd aspects of -- well, everything -- to make broader points about the way we live our lives and the decisions we're making with society. Over the last few years of his life, though, he got particularly bitter -- not just biting and sarcastic, which characterizes his whole body of work -- but really angry and disaffected. A consequence of living the last decade of your life in, well, this decade we're in, I'm afraid.</p>\n<p>Anyway, so that's why it was nice to read some of the stories and essays in this collection -- they read like the younger (relatively), less bitter Vonnegut -- the voice like Heller's in <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Catch-22</span> that's just trying to catch a glimpse of what war's about, what good it could possibly be for.</p>\n<p>So I like this collection as a better epitaph to Vonnegut's whole career than the last non-posthumous book he published, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\"><a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2005/09/28/a-man-without-a-country-by-kurt-vonnegut/\">A Man Without a Country</a>.</span> Not the finest literature of his life, but a pure, clear voice in a context of chaos.</p>\n<p>So it goes.</p>\n",

The featured company in the article is <a href=\"http://www.compumentor.org\">TechSoup</a> (formerly Compumentor), and Mozilla features in the article as well.\n\nI was really happy to see Markoff write this piece -- it's clear from here that there's a new type of organization emerging in the world that we term \"hybrid\" -- mission-driven companies like Mozilla and TechSoup, but who compete in the market with products and services. It seems to me that this is happening because the barriers to collaboration are falling precipitously -- it's easier and cheaper than ever to get together with a group of like-minded folks to work on changing the world. So people seem to be doing it, which is wonderful.\n\nTechSoup is hosting the 3rd annual <a href=\"http://www.netsquared.org\">NetSquared Conference</a> today (and blogging it <a href=\"http://www.netsquared.org/conference/news\">here</a>). The conference is outstanding, and was incredibly helpful to the <a href=\"http://getmiro.com\">PCF/Miro</a> team last year, resulting in some long-lasting relationships.\n\nNetSquared is a great gettogether of lots of organizations like this, and hopefully a preview of things to come, with more social mission organizations in the world. The TechSoup folks deserve a lot of praise for this sort of foresight and investment.\n",

Like everything else at Mozilla, anything we do will be rooted in the fundamentals of user control, data privacy, and transparency with our community and users.\n\n-------\n\nHad a <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/13/mozilla-stealth-data-project-could-be-just-what-the-internet-needs/\">great conversation with Mike Arrington</a> from <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/\">TechCrunch</a> yesterday -- resulted in a <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/13/mozilla-stealth-data-project-could-be-just-what-the-internet-needs/\">nice writeup</a> of one of the projects we've been thinking about here at Mozilla over the last few months. He highlights the opportunity quite well, I think, and I'd like to add some context here so everyone knows where we're coming from. One correction that I need to make up front: \"stealth project\" should read \"very early stage project that Mozilla has been open about,\" but that's probably not quite as catchy a headline. :-)\n\n<strong>Meeting Context</strong>\nFor most of our hour we spent was talking about the upcoming release of <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html\">Firefox 3</a> -- which is on the way very soon now, and is a release that everyone involved is very proud of.\n\nTowards the end of our time, Mike asked: \"What's next?\"\n\nWe answered similarly to our <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/8301-13505_1-9893479-16.html\">conversation with Matt Asay a while back</a>, in that we've got about 4 things we're spending a fair bit of time thinking about: (1) the future of Firefox and the technology that powers it (the new version we're calling moz2), (2) <a href=\"http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/FennecVision\">mobile Firefox</a> (code-named Fennec), (3) online services like <a href=\"http://labs.mozilla.com/featured-projects/#weave\">Weave</a>, and (4) data. Mike was particularly interested in the 4th item, data, and saw a lot of possibility in it.\n\n<strong>Key Insight</strong>\nThe key insight is not so much that rich clients or web sites are able to collect information about what people do, but rather that this data is one of the most important pieces to faciliate understanding (and innovation), and is also one of the most under-explored areas of the modern web.\n\nI'll say it again another way: while technology has gotten cheaper &amp; cheaper to deploy, and the connected nature of the global web means that you can start up a new worldwide service practically overnight for very little capital, there remain worlds of information about how people use the web that are locked up and not currently shared.\n\nSo we asked ourselves what we can do to help unlock some of this latent potential -- and started thinking about whether there's a project we can do at Mozilla that does a few things:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Collects &amp; shares data in a way that embodies the user control &amp; privacy options which are at Mozilla's core.</li>\n\t<li>Enables everyone -- from individual researchers and entrepreneurs (both the social and capitalist types) to the largest organizations in the world -- to take usage data, mix it up, mash it up, derive insight, and hopefully share some of that insight with others.</li>\n\t<li>Helps move the conversation around data collection and web usage forward, to help consumers make more informed decisions.</li>\n</ol>\nIt seems obvious to us that there's lots to be done here, and lots that we can do, if we can work with our broad community to figure it out.\n\n<strong>The Current Situation at Mozilla\n</strong>First things first: we track very very little data today. I've posted before that <a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2007/11/27/mozilla-firefox-market-share/\">we use our Application Update Service (AUS) pings to get a sense of where our main usage around the world is</a> and to try to spot problems when they happen (it's notable that this is a secondary usage of that system -- the primary function of AUS is to enable timely updates to the softeware we release -- in Firefox 3 and future versions of Firefox 2, we'll watch instead an analogous ping that checks whether updates to add-ons are available.)

Very happy to have been able to seen it live and was blown away by how great it was.

I loved it -- couldn't have been any better in my book. It even had a surprise ending! (No, I'm serious! A movie about modernist type ended by mentioning the new MySpace aesthetic -- I was talking about that idea to someone just the other day.)</p>\n<p>Among other observations, one is that once you watch this movie, you'll notice that Helvetica is used for <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">everything</span> around us. I noticed that while I was watching the movie, I was eating food with Helvetica lettering used on the package, the United Airlines material all used it, including the seats, the book next to me was lettered in it on the cover, it's default for a bunch of my display on my Mac, and of course is all around the UI on my iPhone. It's just about ubiquitous.</p>\n<p>And it's sort of incredible in its neutrality and versatility -- you can use it in almost any context because of that neutrality.</p>\n<p>Finally, though, as you watch you just have to appreciate the letterforms themselves. It's a really monumental piece of work -- this typeface that does so much of our hard work in typography but is also so expressive. And I've never really looked at the way that the letters in words set in Helvetica bold really, really hold together in an incredibly stable way. It's hard to imagine a single thing being different about the type.</p>\n<p>Beautiful, beautiful movie, and very highly recommended.</p>\n<p>[also watched Juno on the flight out, and thought that was a great movie, too, in a completely &amp; utterly different way]</p>\n",

Ariely goes through a bunch of experiments that show that while people very often behave irrationally (relative to economic models of self-interest &amp; such), most of the time they do it in predictable ways, for predictable reasons -- and so he's really arguing that behavioral economics -- theorizing about what people will do based not just on rational analysis, but also based on the rational flaws inherent in communities of people -- is a powerful way to model real world phenomena.</p>\n<p>Here are a few gems from the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...the sensitivity we show to price changes might in fact be largely a result of our memory for the prices we have paid in the past and our desire for coherence with our past decision -- not at all a reflection of our true preferences or our level of demand.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's in the part of the book that explains why we pay $3.50 for a cup of coffee. :-)</p>\n<p>But more meaningful to me in some of the things I think about lately:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"This experiment illustrates an unfortunate fact: when a social norm collides with a market norm, the social norm goes away for a long time. In other words, social relationships are not easy to reestablish. Once the bloom is off hte rose -- once a social norm is trumped by a market norm -- it will rarely return.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And more succinctly: \"Money, as it turns out, is very often the most expensive way to motivate people. Social norms are not only cheaper, but often more effective as well.\"</p>\n<p>Great book, lots of great stuff in it.</p>\n",

Reminds me why I mostly don't read business books. There are some good things to remember in this book -- in particular, that models are always simplifications and there are always better models potentially. Moreover, there are often models which are opposed to each other, but still useful to contemplate both. And that some of the most successful organizations not only don't oversimplify, but they embrace the messiness of real life without getting overcome by it. That's one of the lessons that's relevant for Mozilla -- when people ask me to draw an org chart or explain exactly how things work, I always grimace. Not because it's not doable, but because there's a lot of complexity and nuance that seems non-determinant and arcane to most folks -- but much of that nuance is what really makes things go.</p>\n",

Since the new year, I've read probably 8 books this way, compared with 3 or 4 traditional form books.\n\nA few random observations:\n<ul>\n\t<li>the industrial design is, as people have noted, sort of ugly -- but not ugly enough to really get in the way, and it does tend to disappear when I'm actually using it</li>\n\t<li>but the forward &amp; backwards buttons are just too big &amp; easy to hit -- I do unintentionally flip pages pretty frequently</li>\n\t<li>the keyboard is fine, and doesn't particularly get in the way -- to the contrary, it gives me a place to keep my thumb when I'm reading</li>\n\t<li>it's great great great for reading with one hand -- much better than a traditional book</li>\n\t<li>to my eyes, it is basically like reading paper (although not as contrasty) -- but long passages don't fatigue my eyes the same way that my laptop or iphone do</li>\n</ul>\nThe most important thing about the Kindle, though, is the content, of course. About 60-70% of the books that I tend to read are available (albeit with DRM) through Amazon, and it hasn't taken me long to get to my typical state of affairs in the physical world: a backlog of about 10 books that I've read the first chapters of. It's incredibly easy and gratifying to pick up the Kindle, not see anything I want to read, pull up the Amazon store, and buy a new book to read -- delivery happens nearly instantaneously -- takes under a minute. There are big problems with this type of device/software/service/content lock-in (er, \"integration,\" I mean), including the tendency to buy/read the things that are available conveniently, instead of what I'm interested in more broadly.\n\nThe display works great -- the resolution is not quite what I expected, but not bad at all, and is fine for reading even over a long period of time.

But I'm not 100% sure that's the right solution, either.\n\nSharing is another disappointing aspect - I've read a few books the last couple of months that I'd really like to just hand to my friends. There's no way to do that, and it's disappointing.\n\nA million other thoughts about the system, ranging from big picture (I wish it were more open and less DRM-ed, for example) to small (the unit seems almost designed to show dirt on the casing; the dictionary -- while fantastically useful -- could be easier to use) to mostly irrelevant (not a good web browsing experience -- IMHO they should have just left the browser out).\n\nBut on the whole, while I don't know that the Kindle will be the device that ultimately wins, I do know that the advantages of electronic, networked books are too significant not to become ubiquitious over time. It's early days, and this is really just the 2nd generation or so -- but for a broad, broad set of uses, it's obviously the way things are going to go.\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><span style=\"color:#0000EE;\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21d8tOXTlFL.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p>I read Russo's <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Empire Falls</span> a few years back, and think it's an exceptional piece of work. Since my son was born, I read everything slightly differently, and Russo is one, in particular, who keeps coming back to themes on what it means to be a son, to be a father. <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Bridge of Sighs</span> is a very good book -- not as good as <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Empire Falls,</span> but still a really wonderful novel. But rather than talk about Russo, I think I'll put in some of his own words. Mostly, it's a great story told by a man in middle age about his life growing up -- and periodically he stops the narrative to try to synthesize. Here's a relatively lengthy passage that comes early in the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Odd, how our view of human destiny changes over the course of a lifetime. In youth we believe what the young believe, that life is all choice. We stand before a hundred doors, choose to enter one, where we're faced with a hundred more and then choose again. We choose not just what we'll do, but who we'll be. Perhaps the sound of all those doors swinging shut behind us each time we select this one or that one should trouble us, but it doesn't. Nor does the fact that the doors often are identical and even lead in some cases to the exact same place. Occasionally a door is locked, but no matter, since so many others remain available. The distinct possibility that choice itself my be an illusion is something we disregard, because we're curious to know what's behind the next door, the one we hope will lead us to the very heart of the mystery. Even in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary we remain confident that when we emerge, with all our choosing done, we'll have found not just our true destination but also its meaning. The young see life this way, front to back, their eyes to the telescope that anxiously scans the infinite sky and its myriad possibilities. Religion, seducing us with free will while warning us of our responsibility, reinforces youth's need to see itself at the dramatic center, saying yes to this and no to that, against the backdrop of a great moral reckoning.</p>\n\n  <p>But at some point all of that changes. Doubt, born of disappointment and repetition, replaces curiosity. In our weariness we begin to sense the truth, that more doors have closed behind than remain ahead, and for the first time we're tempted to swing the telescope around and peer at the world through the wrong end -- though who can say it's wrong? How different things look then! Larger patterns emerge, individual decisions receding into insignificance. To see a life back to front, as everyone begins to do in middle age, is to strip it of its mystery and wrap it in inevitability, drama's enemy.Or so it sometimes seems to me...the man I've become, the life I've lived, what are these but dominoes that fall not as I would have them but simply as they must?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is amazingly articulate about the interior musings of our lives and how they change as we all get older. To be clear, I don't share this same outlook, but as I reflect on being a father and having a family, I'm beginning to understand the way this thought pattern works, and that people really feel this closing of doors, this inevitability of dominoes falling. For myself, I still see nothing but doors and opportunities, and hope that I can see them until my last breath (hopefully a long long time in the future!). But for Russo to be able to articulate this sense is a really wonderful gift, I think, and I enjoyed this book.</p>\n",

Here's a <a href=\"http://wtfcnn.blogspot.com/\">site with some of the more absurd headlines from CNN</a> lately, but even without the news about how Bono's neighbors' smoke is bothering him or tips on how you can live in a spaceship (both, sadly, actual headlines), I've felt that CNN on the Web has gotten painfully bad (not to mention gems on television like Anderson Cooper 360, because, as everyone knows, he is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mole_(US_TV_series)\">The Mole</a>.) The most egregious problem I've noticed lately is the ridiculous inclusion of articles written by advertising partners like CareerBuilder.com -- while there are notes that they're written by business partners, they're packaged and formatted like any other articles on the site -- painful, painful bias.)\n\nI keep checking CNN for my news mostly from habit and muscle memory, but need to find something better. I think what I'm looking for has these characteristics:\n<ul>\n\t<li>broad &amp; international -- I'm interested in all of it -- worldwide news, but also US sports, entertainment, business, tech, etc</li>\n\t<li>not too overwhelming -- the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com\">CNN.com</a> home page is about the right number of articles</li>\n\t<li>no advertiser-based editorial bias/inclusion of articles by advertisers</li>\n\t<li>ideally, edited by humans</li>\n</ul>\nI'm looking for something that's coherent, too -- not an aggregate reporting like <a href=\"http://www.digg.com\">Digg</a> or <a href=\"http://news.google.com\">Google News</a>.\n\nAny favorites?\n",

				"title": "MacBook Air",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I've had my MacBook Air for a month or so now, and wanted to write some things down about it. The bottom line is that for me, it is so far a really great machine that I like a lot. But it's decidedly not for everyone -- I think for most folks that it won't be a good choice, but it will lead to more work to slim down laptops overall, and eventually start to make them more invisible.</p>\n<p>The physical characteristics are all completely wonderful. It's light, it's thin (so thin that it's actually hard to find a good bag to carry it around in), and the feel of it is just terrific. It's a clearly different feel to carry it around, and when it's closed on a table it tends to disappear. In general, it just gets in the way less than most other computer technology does. It's hard to overstate how good the physicality of the machine is -- it's the best feeling machine I've ever worked on.</p>\n<p>The screen is incredibly, incredibly bright. And I've come to really like the flat chiclet keyboards that the MacBooks (but not the MBPs) ship with. I also really like the SSD in mine, although, as reported many places elsewhere, it doesn't seem worth the $900 premium -- but in my experience, in addition to making the machine mostly totally silent, it makes application startup &amp; switching feel very very snappy, even on the slower MBA processor. And overall, the machine runs much cooler than my last Intel MBP -- never gets too hot.</p>\n<p>I'm a little indifferent to the multitouch trackpad -- it's not super-easy to map gestures to command key combos, so only a few applications have support presently -- which means that it's not yet becoming muscle memory for me to use pinching &amp; swiping. Maybe once the new MBPs with multitouch become more prevalent we'll start seeing better support.</p>\n<p>It's consistently annoying that there's no battery life indicator on the outside of the laptop -- so I have to open the machine to figure out if I've got any juice left.</p>\n<p>But the main problems, really, are that (1) there's very little disk space, and (2) the ports &amp; connectivity are very minimal. Disk space is self-explanatory -- with 64 GB, I haven't really fully moved in -- have left most of my music and all of my movies and photos off the machine so far, not to mention all my virtual machines. That's causing me to move more aggressively to using web applications for everything -- I now use Pandora for most of my music listening (and have discovered a couple of great bands already), Google Reader for my newsfeeds (in particular because it lets me read news in a synchronized way on my iPhone), and mint.com for our finances (no more Quicken, which I was running Windows in a VM for). And for someone like me who works at a Web company, it's a great prop (\"runs Firefox great! what else do you need??\"). [and, btw, it does indeed run Firefox 3 Beta 4 wonderfully -- it's a really nice release that I think everyone is going to be very happy with.]</p>\n<p>The ports are a bit of a bigger problem. No optical drive, so far, is okay, although it makes it pretty tough to do things like recover from a catastrophic failure. We have an external drive at the office, which I'll undoubtedly have to use. The remote disk stuff is neat, but not particularly performant. Sort of have to ante up for the ethernet adapter, too, and it'll help if you get an external USB hard drive -- since there's no firewire, you can't start this machine up in target disk mode (and can't connect to one in that mode), so overall it's a big PITA to get even a few GB moved around.</p>\n<p>None of that stuff is a huge problem for me, for a couple of reasons. First, I've had a lot of Macs over a lot of years, and I'm resourceful (relative to the mass market) in terms of getting outcomes that I want in over-constrained situations (like no ethernet). More importantly, though, I've got more machines around when I need them -- an iMac in the office at home, a community superdrive at work, etc. Lots of folks have written that the MBA is a great secondary machine for traveling &amp; such -- that's not my situation -- mine is the primary machine, but I've got enough supporting infrastructure around to make it really work.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I like it, and it's making a big difference in how much junk I end up carting around -- it's way smaller, lighter, and still provokes double takes at how thin it is. So far so good.</p>\n",

I'll be very candid and say that I think this is both a very tough job and an amazing opportunity -- and that there are lots of reasons it may not work in terms of revitalizing mail (both Thunderbird and mail overall, which David's done a good job framing in his post). But I'm also very optimistic about the new venture and that we've put together a group of people -- David and Dan, among others, who are very smart, very dedicated, and are committed to rethinking communications from the ground up.</p>\n<p>They've got a near term roadmap starting to develop that should make Thunderbird even more useful for a large variety of people (search improvements) and significantly more suitable for enterprise deployments (inclusion of calendar).</p>\n<p>I'm really excited that the effort is starting to make progress, to hire, to build a team, and to articulate a positive vision for what mail can be. This is a story that will get written over a period of years, built on the very good foundation of Thunderbird, but with much left to go. I'm hopeful and optimistic that it will result in a great series of software releases, but also in a vital, energetic, creative community thinking about how to improve the way that human beings communicate, and making those visions real.</p>\n",

It took me a few weeks to get through, but was really worth it -- I enjoyed it a bunch. The writing wasn't, I think, the best part -- it was a little repetitious -- but the research and the weaving together of a complicated global story of the 1790s in America, Europe and Russia, is amazing &amp; masterful.</p>\n<p>Winik's basic premise is that we often see the history of the 1790s -- a period in which much of the world was questioning the right of kings &amp; queens, and moving boldly towards democracy (although not without some reversals) -- as a set of mostly independent histories: the French Revolution, the American Revolution, the reign of Catherine the Great, ...</p>\n<p>But in truth it was a hyper-connected time, with notables like Thomas Paine, Thaddeus Kosiuszko, and and Lafayette moving from one hot spot to another around the globe, in which kings and queens were more often than not related to each other, and in which the ideas of the Enlightenment spread like fire around the world. That the events in America affected France (and vice versa) is well known &amp; well understood -- that they were intertwined with some of the things happening in broader Europe, including Poland and Russia, was learning for me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I thought this book was great, and worth the time it took to read it. I'll look forward to his next book. (And I'm going to take a break from the late 1700s for a while myself.)</p>\n",

And in a very few circumstances &ndash; once or twice in a lifetime if you&rsquo;re lucky &ndash; the opportunity you get to make a difference is one that has a very large, even global impact. My new role as CEO of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Corporation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> feels like one of those times. [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s Mitchell&rsquo;s announcement.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->]</p>\n<p>For me, joining Mozilla in 2005 was one of those special opportunities. I&rsquo;d been working on my own startup, Reactivity, for the previous 7 years, learning how to build and operate an entrepreneurial venture that was focused on creativity and innovation. I was thinking about what I wanted to do next. I had gotten interested in the dynamics of open source projects through knowing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mitch Kapor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (previously an investor in Reactivity) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mitchell Baker<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the incredible, shocking, amazing story of Firefox during the previous year just blew me away. So I wondered out loud to Mitchell whether or not I could help, and whether Mozilla needed any help.</p>\n<p>At which point she laughed of course, because after this small group of open source, non-corporate, non-profiteers had officially launched Firefox 1.0 a few months earlier, they found themselves in a situation where they had gone from a few hundred thousand users to over 10 million. They were going through a period of intense growth and pressure, not to mention increasing expectations from the whole world. Expectations that they&rsquo;d continue to improve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thunderbird<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that they&rsquo;d foster an increasingly robust community of contributors, and that they&rsquo;d continue to look out for the health of the Web.</p>\n<p>So I joined up, started to help. While I care a lot about products and user experiences (and that&rsquo;s where my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->academic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and early <!-- raw HTML omitted -->career background <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is), that stuff was in excellent condition because of the amazing team of contributors and developers and designers and testers &ndash; so I focused on a couple of bits that needed more help: (1) helping other organizations understand and work better with Mozilla, and (2) getting the Mozilla organization itself to be ready to meet increased expectations from the world, which would demand people growth. Since that summer, we&rsquo;ve grown a lot. We released Firefox 1.5 and 2, as well as Thunderbird 2, grew the number of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->community extensions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to more than 4,000, increased our employee base to something close to 150 worldwide (including beefing up our teams in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Japan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Europe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and starting one in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->China<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), and we&rsquo;ve got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more than 125 million users<!-- raw HTML omitted --> around the world now.</p>\n<p>Along the way, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about Mozilla, open source, and the Web itself. I believe that the Web is the single most important innovation of our lifetimes, for reasons both mundane and profound. It affects everything. Today&rsquo;s Web is healthy due to the efforts of millions of people, for sure &ndash; people and companies and governments, volunteers and employees and contributors &ndash; and every time I interact with people in the Mozilla community, I&rsquo;m blown away by the level of dedication to keeping the Web healthy, and, just as important, participatory, for as many people around the globe as possible.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that I&rsquo;m excited by the challenge of my new job. I&rsquo;ve thought an awful lot about the role of MoCo (our shorthand for the Corporation) in supporting the Mozilla mission and manifesto, as the coordination point for our work on the platform and on Firefox. We&rsquo;ve got a lot to do in the coming years, starting with getting Firefox 3 out the door, and then swiftly followed up by our work in mobile and services. Mozilla2 will be a major step forward on the platform after that, not to mention our new experiments in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Labs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the work that we&rsquo;re doing to move the whole Web forward with Javascript 2, HTML 5 and other standards work.</p>\n<p>Even so, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that the most successful case for MoCo will be when the corporation itself is sort of invisible.

				"content_text": "Sometimes in life, you find an opportunity to make a difference in something you care about, and it feels like, even though you didn't know it at the time, that the last few years have really just been practice, giving you the background, skills and ability to really help. And in a very few circumstances -- once or twice in a lifetime if you're lucky -- the opportunity you get to make a difference is one that has a very large, even global impact. My new role as CEO of <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com\">Mozilla Corporation</a> feels like one of those times. [<a href=\"http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/mitchell/archives/2008/01/mozilla_corporation_ceo_and_ch.html\">Here's Mitchell's announcement.</a>]\n\nFor me, joining Mozilla in 2005 was one of those special opportunities. I'd been working on my own startup, Reactivity, for the previous 7 years, learning how to build and operate an entrepreneurial venture that was focused on creativity and innovation. I was thinking about what I wanted to do next. I had gotten interested in the dynamics of open source projects through knowing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapor\">Mitch Kapor</a> (previously an investor in Reactivity) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_baker\">Mitchell Baker</a>, and the incredible, shocking, amazing story of Firefox during the previous year just blew me away. So I wondered out loud to Mitchell whether or not I could help, and whether Mozilla needed any help.\n\nAt which point she laughed of course, because after this small group of open source, non-corporate, non-profiteers had officially launched Firefox 1.0 a few months earlier, they found themselves in a situation where they had gone from a few hundred thousand users to over 10 million. They were going through a period of intense growth and pressure, not to mention increasing expectations from the whole world. Expectations that they'd continue to improve <a href=\"http://getfirefox.com\">Firefox</a> and <a href=\"http://getthunderbird.com\">Thunderbird</a>, that they'd foster an increasingly robust community of contributors, and that they'd continue to look out for the health of the Web.\n\nSo I joined up, started to help. While I care a lot about products and user experiences (and that's where my <a href=\"http://hci.stanford.edu/\">academic</a> and early <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnlilly\">career background </a>is), that stuff was in excellent condition because of the amazing team of contributors and developers and designers and testers -- so I focused on a couple of bits that needed more help: (1) helping other organizations understand and work better with Mozilla, and (2) getting the Mozilla organization itself to be ready to meet increased expectations from the world, which would demand people growth. Since that summer, we've grown a lot. We released Firefox 1.5 and 2, as well as Thunderbird 2, grew the number of <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\">community extensions</a> to more than 4,000, increased our employee base to something close to 150 worldwide (including beefing up our teams in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla-japan.org/\">Japan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/\">Europe</a>, and starting one in <a href=\"http://mozillaonline.com/\">China</a>), and we've got <a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2007/11/27/mozilla-firefox-market-share/\">more than 125 million users</a> around the world now.\n\nAlong the way, I've learned a lot about Mozilla, open source, and the Web itself. I believe that the Web is the single most important innovation of our lifetimes, for reasons both mundane and profound. It affects everything. Today's Web is healthy due to the efforts of millions of people, for sure -- people and companies and governments, volunteers and employees and contributors -- and every time I interact with people in the Mozilla community, I'm blown away by the level of dedication to keeping the Web healthy, and, just as important, participatory, for as many people around the globe as possible.\n\nIt goes without saying that I'm excited by the challenge of my new job. I've thought an awful lot about the role of MoCo (our shorthand for the Corporation) in supporting the Mozilla mission and manifesto, as the coordination point for our work on the platform and on Firefox. We've got a lot to do in the coming years, starting with getting Firefox 3 out the door, and then swiftly followed up by our work in mobile and services. Mozilla2 will be a major step forward on the platform after that, not to mention our new experiments in <a href=\"http://labs.mozilla.com\">Labs</a> and the work that we're doing to move the whole Web forward with Javascript 2, HTML 5 and other standards work.\n\nEven so, I've come to the conclusion that the most successful case for MoCo will be when the corporation itself is sort of invisible. That is, when MoCo can support <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/about/mozilla-manifesto.html\">Mozilla's mission</a>, providing economic sustainability, project coordination, and a connection to real users around the world, while getting out of the way of what our community all around the world is doing. Understand that I'm not saying that Mozilla should be invisible -- to the contrary, a strong, vibrant and visible Mozilla is having a major positive impact on the evolution of the Web today, and should continue to. What I'm saying is that in a success case, the mechanics of the Corporation -- some of the specifics about the way we organize to get things done -- will not be as apparent (or as in the way as they can sometimes be) as the project.\n\nThat's a deceptively simple goal, certainly. With thousands of contributors, more than 125 million users, and countless organizations that depend on the extended community and our technology, we're in uncharted territory. There aren't any good models for what we're doing right now, for hybrid organizations who're using market-based economics to drive mission-oriented goals, or for open source projects that so many end users depend on. So just like experiments in the code or the user interface, we'll be doing more experiments in how the MoCo organization can best use our products and our people to support the mission. Experiments like Mozilla China, where we've quadrupled our user base this year, and like Mozilla Labs, where we're trying to create a new form of laboratory in which we've never even met most of the experimenters.\n\nA number of these experiments and initiatives Mitchell's already involved in, and there are a number of new initiatives that she can start now. Mitchell has made enormous contributions so far -- from the original Mozilla Public License to being at the helm through the years at AOL, to starting the Foundation, and lately to charting new territory and scale with end-user open source software. Lately she's been thinking more about core issues of participation and openness for end users, how to make hybrid organizations work, and how to unstick the often frustrating standards process. I expect her to pull Mozilla into new areas and to continue to be the chief advocate for the participatory Web. From a very personal standpoint, I've learned an awful lot from Mitchell over the past couple of years, and am looking forward to being challenged by and working with her more going forward.\n\nThere's a lot to do, by a lot of people. For myself, I've got a few major priorities for the coming months:\n\n1. Do whatever I can to help get Firefox 3 out the door -- <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0b2/releasenotes/\">beta 2 just released</a>, and folks who have used it feel like it's an exceptionally good product that an awful lot of people will like (and do already).\n\n2. Help <a href=\"http://www.ascher.ca/blog/\">David Ascher</a> get the new Mozilla mail company off the ground, and get Thunderbird on a safe footing for the future.\n\n3. Improve Mozilla's understandability and knowability across the board. While we've grown over the past couple of years, it's been hard to make sure that we're always communicating as well as we're able to, and as well as our community and users need us to. We try hard on this, and we're improving, but we can and will do more.\n\n4. Increase our communications about how we're thinking about economic sustainability -- we've got some things figured out and some we haven't -- but I'd like us to start talking more in public about how the future looks for Mozilla, and I'd especially like to share our thinking with, and benefit from others' thinking on how to make hybrid organizations work. (Organizations that come to mind include the <a href=\"http://pculture.org\">Participatory Culture Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org\">kiva.org</a>.)\n\n5. Support Mitchell's new projects to broaden Mozilla's impact -- she's been thinking about a number of new initiatives over the past few months that could have a great effect on the world.\n\nThat's a start, anyway. As is the norm for Mozilla, the number and variety of projects that we can be involved in and make a difference for is astounding -- and I'm optimistic that we'll be able to continue to improve the participatory Web in 2008 and beyond.\n\nI feel both very excited and very fortunate to find myself in this spot, and am looking forward to doing what I can to help Mozilla continue to make the Web a better place.\n",

The content is great -- and I've heard good things about his previous work, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Fooled by Randomness.</span> I found his writing style nearly unreadable, not to mention condescending and dismissive of anyone who thinks differently at all -- but in spite of the stylistic issues, the content is great. He spends a lot of time talking about how people, by and large, are fooled by their models into thinking they have predictive power in the real world. He says that would be true if we lived in a normal distribution type of world, but for the vast majority of things we care about -- like elections, stock market swings, success in almost any field -- we live in a decidedly not normally distributed world.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\">\"black swan\" theme</a> -- that while most swans in nature are white, sometimes they're black -- is throughout the book, and the main point is this: the relative rarity of black swans means that they're often surprising to people, and that too many lessons are inferred from their existence, even when they're not based in any reasonable thought. Google &amp; Facebook are both black swans -- highly unlikely strings of events allowed them to become what they are -- and most of the \"do it this way\" lessons that entrepreneurs are trying to infer from their success are simply not applicable.

As usual, Ellis conveys a huge sense of the humanity of our founders, and the real uncertainty of the time. Also as usual, he highlights the landmark differences between the 1776 mood of the Declaration of Independence and the 1787 times of the writing and ratification of the Constitution. What surprised me most (liking it a lot didn't surprise me at all) was how relevant the discussion is to things I think about today -- not just in our government but also related to Mozilla. The ways that the founders engaged in discussions, the new ideas like multi-sovereignty that they pioneered, and the difficulties and opportunities inherent in building a republic at scale -- they all spoke to me and had lessons for me in things I work on now.</p>\n<p>Loved the book, love the period of history, and loved Ellis' writing, as usual.</p>\n",

Goldsmith doesn't have any particular ethical objection to torture -- in fact, he supports it -- but he has strong objections to how we're going about it. In particular, he argued with Gonzales and Cheney et al that the executive branch of our government should have worked <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">with</span> Congress to pass laws which would explicitly make what we're doing in Guantanamo and elsewhere legal. He objects to the overreach of the Executive branch and the needless use/usurpation of power that they've exhibited over the past several years.</p>\n<p>What this book did for me was to help me understand what's happening in our government today, and to separate the issues of what I believe is ethical (and how America &amp; Americans should behave) from what is lawful under our Constitution and laws. And it reinforced to me that future generations will look back at these two terms and bemoan the fundamental weakening of our governmental system by the Bush Administration. The disdain it has for checks and balances, the love of secrecy, and the conviction that fighting to keep Americans safe means that they shouldn't have to be accountable to those same citizens they're trying to secure.</p>\n<p>It also was great to read a long, well-reasoned, complete argument for something, even though I don't believe in the fundamental basis for that argument. Reminded me that we're living in a sound bite oriented world, and we need to try not to be.</p>\n<p>Recommended for anyone who's interested in how the legal aspects of our present government work, although the politics will be tough for blue staters.</p>\n",

Took me just a day to read it -- it's a short book, but also a fun one. It doesn't cover the period of Martin's life that's most familiar to me (and folks my age, I presume) -- it goes from his childhood through the late 70s when he finished doing his standup and focused on movies instead. I guess it's easy to dismiss Martin today as a little past his power years, but this book reminded me of so much that I love about his comedy, and so much of what he did that had tremendous, broad impact (aside from making The Jerk, one of the best movies of all time). One of the things that's great about the book is that it goes through his early years that he spent in Southern California -- getting a magic set, working at Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland -- trying lots and lots of material and keeping track of what worked and didn't. He's clearly an intellectual, hard-working comedian, and blazed new trails in absurdist comedy. We also caught his honoring at Lincoln Center a couple of weeks ago -- the clips of his stand up days and time hosting SNL are still completely drop-down funny.</p>\n",

Worth reading if you're interested in Chinese contemporary culture.</p>\n",

I have too many personal reactions and feelings about the book to write a very useful review, I think. My short analysis, though, is that it's definitely not a \"modern version of Tracy Kidder's <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Soul of a New Machine,\"</span> as some of the reviews claim. Kidder's book about Data General and the techie culture of Route 128 was a seminal achievement, and one of the first really useful and understandable accounts about how techies do their work.</p>\n<p>This book tried to give insight like that into the software industry, and at the same time tried to describe open source dynamics, and I think it was only marginally successful at each. It also illustrates the authorial hazard of trying to write history while it's happening -- when he was choosing his subject matter, it seemed likely (to some/many) that OSAF would be the super-successful open source project for consumers -- Mozilla was a bit of an afterthought at that point -- but we know how the Mozilla story played out, while OSAF is still a bit in the middle.</p>\n<p>I think many of his conclusions (software is hard, for example, or that complexity is outrunning our ability to cope with it) are too heavily rooted in the particulars of OSAF, and he would have had a completely different outlook, and made different conclusions, if he had been at Mozilla or Google or Facebook over the past few years.</p>\n<p>It's an okay book, but I think has the serious flaw that he was trying to write about history while it was being created, and lacks a sense of perspective as a result.</p>\n",

And by any account, our market share everywhere is growing &ndash; extremely quickly in places like Spain and China and Brazil, somewhat more moderately in the US and Japan &ndash; but growing in every locale around the world.</p>\n<p>But let&rsquo;s go back a step: Mozilla (in all forms, including the Foundation, the Corporation, etc) is a public benefit endeavor, with the primary mission of keeping the Internet open and participatory. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So why would we care about market share,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> something that&rsquo;s traditionally associated with shall-we-say less mission-oriented motivations? In my view there are at least 3 basic reasons that we care (and probably many more):</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We also look to data from individual sites to help us understand Firefox usage. Historically we&rsquo;ve skewed very high on techie sites and early adopter sites &ndash; for many Silicon Valley startups Firefox use represents well over half their traffic for a significant part of their early life. Conversely, we&rsquo;ll tend to see lower-than-average Firefox usage on some of the more mass market populations. It&rsquo;s been hard for us to share this type of data broadly because of the idiosyncratic nature of what we see, and because most of this type of data is shared with us with the understanding that we&rsquo;ll not republish. But on the whole, the data that we&rsquo;re seeing shows Firefox at something like 19-20% worldwide on sites that we consider mainstream.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another, subtler issue here: most of these measures are in page views, not users. (This makes sense, as by and large, the thing that folks are trying to track is market share of web properties, not the applications that you use to get to them.) As hard as it is to get an accurate read on worldwide traffic numbers for Firefox, it&rsquo;s even harder to figure out the relationship between page views and users. We have some intuitions here, supported by anecdotal evidence, that Firefox users look at more pages and do more searches than typical users, but nothing that I&rsquo;d actually call science.</p>\n<p>So in addition to these indicators, we also use our own systems to get a sense of the number of actual Firefox users there are in the world (using each language version).</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At present, we believe there are at least 125,000,000 Firefox users in the world, give or take.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how we get to that number. Firefox uses a system that we call AUS (Application Update Service) to keep itself up-to-date with security patches &amp; such. Around once a day, Firefox will ping Mozilla servers to see if there&rsquo;s a new update available, and if there is, it&rsquo;ll present an option to users to download and install it. (AUS really deserves a longer posting &ndash; the ping is non-identifiable, respecting user privacy, and is one of the major reasons that the Firefox user base, as large as it is, is nearly all using the most recent, patched version at any given time.)</p>\n<p>We count those pings, categorized by language version of Firefox, so we have a rough indication for any given day about how many instances of Firefox were running. (It&rsquo;s decidedly rough &ndash; part of that is algorithmic, part of it is due to Firefox running in enterprises behind firewalls or other complex topologies, and part of it is usage based, depending on how people start and stop the application.) It&rsquo;s rough, but it&rsquo;s close, and we&rsquo;ve kept track of the numbers over the past couple of years, since we released Firefox 1.5 (the first Firefox that included AUS). We call these Active Daily Users, and it&rsquo;s a measure of the successful pings in a given day. Here&rsquo;s a chart of Active Daily Users over the last year, since we released Firefox 2 at the end of October 2006:</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>What that says is that averaged over a 7 day period, we&rsquo;ve gone from 23M Active Daily Users in October 2006 to 42M a couple of weeks ago. (And we actually hit 48.8M yesterday, an all-time high that shows continued strong growth over the last few months.)</p>\n<p>To get from the ADU number to our whole worldwide number of users, measured in terms of uniques in a given month, like most every web site does, we multiply ADU by 3. So for a couple of weeks ago, with 42M ADUs, we compute that we have something in excess of 126M unique monthly users.</p>\n<p>This is a conservative multiplier (we think it could be more like 3.5) that we&rsquo;ve gotten to by doing some of our own experiments, piecing together data we&rsquo;ve received from sites who have done their own calculations, and then really testing them against the best common sense top-down tests we can. Here&rsquo;s one: take our estimate of monthly users (126M) and divide by the whole number of Internet users in the world (Internet World Stats puts the current at 1.2B)  &ndash; you end up with about 10.5%, which is lower than most reports of our global traffic share. You can do a bunch of mental gymnastics from there to account for higher-page-views-than-average for typical Firefox users, an overcounting of usage worldwide, etc &ndash; but for our purposes here at Mozilla, we use a multiplier of 3 to approximate the number of worldwide Firefox users.</p>\n<p>But, really, the absolute number of users around the world is less important than the trending. Are more people finding their way to Firefox? (yes!) How about in Brazil? (yes again) What happens over holidays? (people don&rsquo;t use their computers as much &ndash; yay!) What happens when we do security updates? (usage goes down as anti-virus software updates get propagated, but recovers over the following week or 2)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Phew. That was a longer post than I thought it would be. More to come on topics like the annual autumn surge in usage, huge growth in China and Spain this year, and others.</p>\n",

I'll come back to some of the basic concepts frequently, as they're building blocks for some of the ways we look at the world.\n\n---\n\nOne of the most interesting things about Mozilla is figuring out how we're doing, and where to focus and spend time. We look at many indicators; some of the most important are things like the health of <a href=\"http://addons.mozilla.org\">addons.mozilla.org</a>, the volume and quality of community contributions to our platform and products, and the vitality of Mozilla-related discussions in the blogosphere. 2 other more numerical indicators that we track are Firefox market share (sliced a number of different ways) and the raw number of users of Firefox.\n\nLots of people report market share for Firefox -- it's a succinct indicator of momentum in the market and with users, and makes a great headline to report that we're eating IE's share worldwide, or have exceeded 30% in Germany, or have tripled our share in China this year.

In my view there are at least 3 basic reasons that we care (and probably many more):\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<em>It's one indicator for how we're doing</em>, how people like the products that we offer, and how well we're communicating. Not the only indicator; not the most important; but a significant indicator, nonetheless.</li>\n\t<li>\n<em>It helps us ask questions that let us support our mission better.</em> Including these (but there are many, many more):\n<ul>\n\t<li>Why is our market share so high in Europe compared to the US?\n(50% higher, and more in some countries) Understanding why some countries exhibit higher usage than others can provide pointers to how to build a more relevant product for more users, and how to communicate about the product.</li>\n\t<li>Why are so many people in China using the English version of Firefox?\n(as much as 20%) Is it just that people use English for business? Is there some perceived difference? Understanding this can help us make both our Chinese language version better and even potentially our English language version for folks using it in China.</li>\n\t<li>Where can we use market share most effectively to help the spread of Web standards? (everywhere but Korea, for the moment)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\t<li>\n<em>We believe Firefox is a superior product, and so we want as many people as possible to use it, or at least know there's a choice.</em> While I'm happy that there's increased innovation in the browser space lately, I think that Firefox has the very best blend of features, extensibility, and simplicity, not to mention the fastest security patching in the industry, by a longshot.</li>\n</ul>\nBut market share reports have issues. The most basic issue is that there's no way to really represent the complexity and the dynamism of the global Web -- it's just too big, with too many things changing too rapidly. Different studies have different biases: some are oriented towards early adopters (like <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp\">W3Schools</a>, who reports Firefox at 36%), some (like <a href=\"http://www.xitimonitor.com/\">XitiMonitor</a>) will bias towards European properties, and currently all studies undercount or neglect usage in Asia, South America and Africa (all admittedly tricky to characterize usage in). Don't misunderstand: all of these studies are extremely useful and help understand what's happening around the world. I'm just asserting that it's very important to understand the limits of particular studies and the assumptions that are baked in.\n\nWe also look to data from individual sites to help us understand Firefox usage. Historically we've skewed very high on techie sites and early adopter sites -- for many Silicon Valley startups Firefox use represents well over half their traffic for a significant part of their early life. Conversely, we'll tend to see lower-than-average Firefox usage on some of the more mass market populations.

Here's a chart of Active Daily Users over the last year, since we released Firefox 2 at the end of October 2006:\n\n<a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/picture-10.png\" title=\"Firefox AUS Since FX2\"><img src=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/picture-10.png\" alt=\"Firefox AUS Since FX2\"></a>\n\nWhat that says is that averaged over a 7 day period, we've gone from 23M Active Daily Users in October 2006 to 42M a couple of weeks ago. (And we actually hit 48.8M yesterday, an all-time high that shows continued strong growth over the last few months.)\n\nTo get from the ADU number to our whole worldwide number of users, measured in terms of uniques in a given month, like most every web site does, we multiply ADU by 3. So for a couple of weeks ago, with 42M ADUs, we compute that we have something in excess of 126M unique monthly users.\n\nThis is a conservative multiplier (we think it could be more like 3.5) that we've gotten to by doing some of our own experiments, piecing together data we've received from sites who have done their own calculations, and then really testing them against the best common sense top-down tests we can. Here's one: take our estimate of monthly users (126M) and divide by the whole number of Internet users in the world (Internet World Stats puts the current at 1.2B)  -- you end up with about 10.5%, which is lower than most reports of our global traffic share. You can do a bunch of mental gymnastics from there to account for higher-page-views-than-average for typical Firefox users, an overcounting of usage worldwide, etc -- but for our purposes here at Mozilla, we use a multiplier of 3 to approximate the number of worldwide Firefox users.\n\nBut, really, the absolute number of users around the world is less important than the trending. Are more people finding their way to Firefox? (yes!) How about in Brazil? (yes again) What happens over holidays? (people don't use their computers as much -- yay!) What happens when we do security updates? (usage goes down as anti-virus software updates get propagated, but recovers over the following week or 2)\n\n---\n\nPhew. That was a longer post than I thought it would be. More to come on topics like the annual autumn surge in usage, huge growth in China and Spain this year, and others.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I'm really happy that something called \"Data Detectors\" has shown up in mail.app (at least) in Leopard. This is something that ATG (Apple Technology Group -- the research labs) had prototyped maybe 10 years ago when I was there. The idea is that we tend to get certain types of semi-structured data in e-mails: suggested meeting times, contact info, things like that. Here's an example from my in box yesterday:</p><br>\n<img src=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/picture-5.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"42\"><br>\nNow when I hover over \"Monday November 5th at 2:00pm\", I get a clickable menu with 2 items: \"Create New iCal Event...\" and \"Show Date in iCal\". Selecting the first gives me this menu, mostly filled in with all the right information (note that it even picked up San Francisco as a location later in the sentence - amazing! - even though it didn't understand enough about the context to get it right):<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/picture-6.png\" width=\"302\" height=\"322\"><br>\nFor my money, this is just one of the coolest things ever. Works for contact information, too -- tends to work well on the contact blocks at the bottom of peoples' e-mails. (Although I think I'd like contacts to be somewhat more automatic -- I'd like to just have a big always updating database of all the contact info in all my mail all the time, synced to my iPhone -- so while I think the data detector tech is really neat here, I think the usage context is a bit different.)\n",

I've liked Hornby since <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">High Fidelity</span>, and again with <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">About a Boy</span>, although his more recent work hasn't captured me as much. One of the things he's very very good at is writing with a distinctive, clear point of view, and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Slam</span> does a great job with that. It's written from the viewpoint of an 18 year old boy who deals with a challenging few years from 16 to 18. Wonders whether you're doomed to repeat the same patterns as your family, how to grow up, etc. I really enjoyed it, and think Hornby's done a fine job.</p>\n<p>I'll contrast it with <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The Gum Thief,</span> Douglas Coupland's new novel, which I'm mired in the middle of. POV is Coupland's great strength, too, and in his new book, it's exceptional as usual -- but it's just a little depressing &amp; slow, and so has taken me a couple of weeks to get through the first hundred pages. (FWIW, if you haven't read Coupland's <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Hey, Nostradamus,</span> you should -- very underappreciated book by him.)</p>\n",

(As an added bonus, it provides exactly the type of entertainment a 2 year old boy is looking for.)\n\nAlas. \n\nWe tried it out last night, and it pretty much was a failure. Sorta mopped okay, sorta swept up okay, but was incredibly loud and pretty slow. I had visions of us unleashing little Scooba each night to eat up the leftovers, sort of like the vacuum from The Jetsons. But way too noisy for that to work. \n\nIf any robots are reading this blog, hear this: you need to step up your game, or you'll never be our overlords on earth. Come on, robots.\n",

It's really a book of (mostly) short essays about random things that Almond thinks about, like hating the Red Sox, getting married, having a kiddo. Good, funny, pop culture essays, but sometimes a little more bitter than I like.</p>\n<p>But the meat of the book is an essay that Almond wrote about Kurt Vonnegut, his favorite author (and one of mine, along with McCarthy, Coupland, and Murakami). It's a great, extended piece about how he feels about liking Vonnegut's work (sometimes juvenile, sometimes not). Was fun to read, but probably worth borrowing from me, not buying, if you're interested.</p>\n",

Keynote is the absolute best presentation building tool around. Nothing better right now. It's nearly impossible to make a deck that looks anything but fantastic. Playing around with wide screen views now, not to mention voice overs, saving to YouTube, etc. Great evolution on an already very good application (as soon as you change your brain to think in a particular way).</p>\n<p>Pages, the word processor/page layout application sucks less than it did before, and is mostly usable now, even in track changes mode. I mostly don't need to open up Word anymore (painful on Rosetta) at all. There are a few things that don't work quite right, but mostly it's acceptable.</p>\n<p>Numbers is basically a toy. Math performance is very very slow; interoperability with Excel is crappy. No pivot tables, only 150 numerical functions, and basically the quirkiest spreadsheet you've ever seen. On the other hand, like the other 2 apps in the suite, it creates documents that look <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">beautiful.</span> I think it's basically a presentation tool for calculations.</p>\n<p>For $79, Keynote is worth it by itself. If you're not doing complicated spreadsheets or lots of contract work, I think it's getting to the point that with iWork and googleApps, there's really no reason to buy Office. It'll be a close decision when Office 2008 comes out for the Mac. I'm honestly not sure I'll get it. From time to time I need to do complicated contract work (lots and lots of revisions -- I'm unsure that I trust Pages for this at present), and sometimes I need to throw a few tens of thousands of rows into a spreadsheet to do some analysis (and I don't think there's any way to do that right now that isn't Excel).</p>\n<p>But for 95% of everything I do, I'll not use Office again to create new documents or share them with others. I think that train has left the station.</p>\n<p>[a slight aside: I actually really like the ribbon UI in Office 2007 on Vista -- I think that's a good innovation (and one that will look completely out of place on the Mac). i also think that the newest version of Excel is fantastic. but not fantastic enough to really want it, and not fantastic enough to justify 4x the price of iWork or an infinite pricing markup on google spreadsheets.]</p>\n",

Everyone interested in China should read it. Written by an NPR correspondent who's reported from Beijing for 6 years, it's a really good bit of insight into what's happening in China now and why. The book jacket reads a bit like a travel book: the frame of the story is 2 trips that Rob took on China's Route 312, and East-West highway that stretches from Shanghai on the East all the way through Urumqi and into Kazakhstan in the West.<br></p>\n<p>But it's a lot more than that; it's a look into the mass migration that's happening in China from rural areas into cities, and from the relatively underdeveloped West to the coastal East of Beijing, Shanghai &amp; Shenzen. He likens it to the travels of the Okies written about by Steinbeck.</p>\n<p>He also gives quite a lot of historical context as he travels through places like Xian (the original capital, I think?), and visits Tibet. There are bits about what the government is doing to bring the West into the rest of China (culturally), and why that's happening. And it's a fun book to read, too.</p>\n<p>Anyway, great book, highly recommended. I recognized a bunch of the places and the phenomena that he talks about from my recent trips, and from my point of view, he does a really admirable job of making some very complicated things accessible to everyone.</p>\n",

It was a candid, sometimes aggressive panel, and was terrific. Then I sat in a very small session with the guy who coined the term \"nanotechnology\" and a couple of other guys who are succeeding with it today. And I just had lunch with some Chinese friends who are working very hard to develop an open culture here. I'm blown away by their mission, their dedication, and what they do every day.</p>\n<p>As for Mozilla, about half the people here who I talk with know about Mozilla and/or Firefox -- and the people that recognize us absolutely love us. It's great. I do feel like a tech nerd, though, next to all these economists, politicians, and world leaders. It's cool, actually.</p>\n<p>More later -- at the moment I'm about to go into a session where all of us on the panel will be nerds. :-) Tariq Krim of Netvibes, Dave Sifry, formerly of Technorati, John Gage of Sun, and some others -- it'll be like being at home...</p>\n<p>Lots to think about -- makes me both realize that the contribution of Mozilla in the world is large (and growing) and can be larger -- and that the way we're doing it -- in a broad, people-focused, open, non-organizational way -- is what many many leaders around the world aspire to.</p>\n<p>And as usual, I feel very lucky to be here on behalf of Mozilla. More soon.</p>\n",

Yesterday I even managed to get a little run in &amp; stay awake until 8p local time (5a California time).</p>\n<p>The hotel I'm in is brand new -- it's the Wenjin Hotel right near Tshinghua Science Park -- the Mozilla office is about 2 blocks away, so it's super-convenient. The hotel is great -- super-shiny, super-stylish, and the staff is very friendly and ready to help. It's sort of like my whole China experience so far -- ultra-modern, brand new stuff, stylish, tons of people around to help -- but also a little empty -- sort of like people are waiting for everyone to move in. It's a strange dichotomy -- it's not like there's a shortage of people -- there are folks everywhere -- but the ubiquity of new construction just seems empty sometimes.</p>\n<p>Having said all that, I've spent a fair bit of time in Europe, Japan and China over the past couple of years, and nowhere feels the same entrepreneurial intensity as Beijing. I've not been to India yet, but for me, at the moment, Beijing feels more like Silicon Valley than any other place I've been.</p>\n<p>More later -- I'll post some pictures to Flickr in a bit, once I get into the office -- I got glimpses of the amazing new buildings going up for the Olympics -- the National Stadium and the National Aquatics Center -- amazing, amazing buildings.</p>\n",

I was surprised to find an article this morning in one of the blogs I read about China -- this is <a href=\"http://www.danwei.org/books/lin_shaohua_on_translating_har.php\">an interview with the writer in China</a> who translates Murakami's work into Chinese. This is something that never occurred to me, really -- I always think of Murakami as fundamentally Japanese, but with American notes -- and to think of him from a new perspective, particularly the Chinese angle, which he writes about some -- is really eye-opening for me. Great interview.\n\nAnother <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/books/review/Murakami-t.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">essay by Murakami in the New York Times</a> this weekend is great -- it talks about how he writes like jazz.  My favorite bit of the interview is Murakami quoting great jazz pianist Thelonious Monk:\n<blockquote>One of my all-time favorite jazz pianists is Thelonious Monk. Once, when someone asked him how he managed to get a certain special sound out of the piano, Monk pointed to the keyboard and said: “It can’t be any new note. When you look at the keyboard, all the notes are there already. But if you mean a note enough, it will sound different. You got to pick the notes you really mean!”</blockquote>\nFanastic. If you <em>mean </em>a note enough, it will sound different. I've always felt that something was different in great works -- Murakami's especially -- and maybe this is it -- the intensity of meaning, of nuance.\n\n<em>After Dark</em> is good so far, but not my favorite. It takes place in the midnight-to-morning hours of Tokyo after the trains have stopped running. Sorta like Murakami's \"Eyes Wide Shut.\" We'll see how the 2nd half goes.\n",

[caveat: the beta that I'm using is a little crashy -- we'll see what happens when I get around to upgrading to the release version.]\n\nPerformance is much better, too -- in fact, I'm running Vista on Parallels, and it's working great.\n\nThey've also included snapshots, which makes Parallels much more suitable for testing than previously -- and the UI for them seems to be a good step forward.\n\nOne side note: I made the mistake of installing Google Desktop on my first instance of Vista, and it really, really made life suck. It's not exactly Google's fault -- the Google indexing + Vista indexing was just completely maxing out my system. (And, in fact, Google has filed a <a href=\"http://battellemedia.com/archives/003714.php\">Justice Department complaint</a> about just this thing, and it seems to me to have some merit.\n\nOver the weekend, since I had Vista installations on my mind, I also tried out VMWare's Fusion Beta 4 -- it seems to me that they're falling further behind Parallels, not catching up. I tried to use Unity (their name for Coherence), which is notable because it does the same thing, but, I guess, with drop shadows, but it doesn't seem to work yet with Vista.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot the last few days about the debate that&rsquo;s been going on about what &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; should do. [I put &ldquo;Mozilla&rdquo; in quotes here because it&rsquo;s a quite unusual &amp; difficult to understand thing &ndash; but the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->link to Mike&rsquo;s post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is maybe the best articulation I&rsquo;ve seen, especially when viewed through special, snark-reducing glasses. (I don&rsquo;t reduce the snark, personally &ndash; it&rsquo;s what I like about Mike&rsquo;s posts.)] Or, rather, what Mozilla should <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do more of<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do faster<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do better<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They&rsquo;re all right, of course. We should do more, faster, and do it better. The criticisms in the debate, both explicit &amp; implicit, tend to create a lot of introspection &amp; wider debate, which I think, ultimately is good, healthy and productive. Even debates like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the one on languages<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that pops up from time to time helps to clarify things.</p>\n<p>Like Mike, I&rsquo;m having a tough time reconciling calls for centralized decision-making in something that&rsquo;s fundamentally decentralized. Even with Mozilla (Foundation + Corporation) making some decisions on where to put money or people to work, I believe we&rsquo;re still one of the most decentralized, global, egalitarian and successful technology/product organisms in the world. But more on that later&hellip;</p>\n<p>What I&rsquo;ve been thinking about specifically this morning is the conversation about whether Mozilla (again, a loosely defined concept at best, but for the moment, let&rsquo;s assume that people mean Mozilla Corporation + Foundation) should focus on Firefox and whether we should focus on building a platform for application development. It&rsquo;s a bit of a false framing of the problem, though, and here&rsquo;s why: Firefox is, of course, an application that somewhere north of 100 million people in the world use to interact with the Internet. (and only around 50% of them use English language versions, which is a topic for another time.) But it also, today, is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 separate and distinct platforms<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for building applications on.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It&rsquo;s XUL, of course, for building extensions &ndash; and at last count, there are around 2,500 extensions that have been written that we know about that run the gamut from trivial to shockingly useful. These extensions work in the browser, and (mostly) make your browsing experience more productive. There are a number of startups who have built these &ndash; several even using Firefox extensions as their initial or primary entry point. Some of the venture-backed (or angel-backed) ones that come immediately to mind are: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->del.icio.us<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StumbleUpon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FoxMarks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JetEye<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yoono<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AllPeers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FoxyTunes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ScribeFire<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AdaptiveBlue<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CoolIris<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; that&rsquo;s 10 quick ones, but there are many more that I&rsquo;ve forgotten or not ever known about.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a framework for building other applications that aren&rsquo;t within the browser &ndash; commonly called (and grouped together) as something called XULRunner (or, more precisely, a collection of things which includes XULRunner, Gecko, and more). We&rsquo;re a little loose in what we call XULRunner, but here I&rsquo;ll just lump together applications that are using XUL as a platform to build more things that aren&rsquo;t browser-based on top of it (I know this is broader than most people&rsquo;s definition). Using XULRunner (or the Mozilla codebase) to build standalone apps (or derivative browsers) is so far quite popular among startups and large enterprises alike. Some of the venture-funded endeavors here are backed by the most successful VCs on the planet, and a brief, non-exhaustive list, includes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joost<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Songbird<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, plus many more in stealth mode and behind corporate firewalls. And not to mention <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thunderbird<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an e-mail client used by 5M+ people, and projects like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Camino<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SeaMonkey<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Democracy Player<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, all of which are doing amazingly well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most importantly, it&rsquo;s the web. In no small measure, the explosion of high interactivity AJAX applications can thank Firefox&rsquo;s emergence in 2004, both in terms of a good platform to develop on (and getting better, with fantastic extensions like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firebug<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), and in terms of the pressure that it&rsquo;s put on Microsoft to put out a better, more standards-oriented browser and do real development on the web again. These applications are uncountable &ndash; thousands, or hundreds-of-thousands. Lots, anyway, and, as I said, resulting in 100M+ Firefox users, even before counting the positive impact on the 100s of millions of more IE users around the world.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And while I&rsquo;m on the subject of the open web, in our web-focused community, we keep talking about it like the fight is won. Like the web is open forever, for everyone. But it isn&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t for, say, the 137M users in China, 99% of whom use IE-based browsers and are plagued by spyware &ndash; most who I talked with figure all the malicious software on their computers is just the price of being on the Internet. It isn&rsquo;t for folks whose langage is Thai or Kurdish or Vietnamese &ndash; or countless others &ndash; who don&rsquo;t yet have a browser that&rsquo;s in their own language. It isn&rsquo;t for Koreans, where the overwhelming force of government and industry has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->built a Windows-oriented monoculture<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>And it isn&rsquo;t, really, even with content. Flash is doing fantastically, driven by successes of companies like YouTube. And there are 3 major, potentially industry-changing efforts (Microsoft&rsquo;s Silverlight, Adobe&rsquo;s Apollo, Sun&rsquo;s JavaFX) to build new platforms that use words like open, but are as proprietary as Java ever was for Sun, and probably more so. They&rsquo;re all awesome technologies, and awesome demos. But they&rsquo;re not the open web. They&rsquo;re built by a vendor, controlled by a vendor, tooled by a vendor. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe&rsquo;s putting up $100M<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; significantly more than the wherewithal of a project like Mozilla &ndash; to help companies take that first hit.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the most useful way to measure, but Mozilla has done this with fewer than 100 employees. We were fewer than half that a year ago, and more like 15 people total 2 years ago. This obviously and absolutely undercounts the whole of Mozilla &ndash; 25%+ code for Firefox was contributed by volunteers; all non-English localizations were; and clearly the debate which I mentioned is involving many, many people in our extended world.</p>\n<p>So here&rsquo;s a little summary. By my count, the absolute most conservative view is that 100 paid people are supporting more than a dozen funded startups building extensions for Firefox, more than a half dozen funded startups building completely new applications, countless web-based application startups, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more than a million users per employee<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. All for less money than Adobe is putting into Apollo&rsquo;s launch. Way less.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s crazy high leverage. As much leverage as any organization I know of in the world.</p>\n<p>Can Mozilla do more? Yes. Can it go faster? Yes. Can Mozilla continue to support a giant ecosystem of enterprises built on top of Moz technology? Absolutely. Can Mozilla do everything? Save the world? Absolutely not. And, to be honest, nobody is more critical of Mozilla than people in our community. Far from being frustrating, it&rsquo;s actually amazing. Enabling. And it&rsquo;s the reason that Mozilla (in the large, not in the Foundation + Corporation sense) keeps moving forward, keeps making things better.</p>\n<p>We do have to make choices, though. There&rsquo;s only so much time, there&rsquo;s only so much attention. It&rsquo;s tough for a small band of folks to change the world, and sometimes you do things in an order you may not like the best.</p>\n<p>But some days we&rsquo;re faced with real, explicit choices. Like whether to ship Firefox 3 this year. Or how much time to devote to making sure that those aforementioned Thais can finally get a browser that actually works in their native language. Or how to help users in Dalian, users in Osaka, users in Great Falls, users in Ankara &ndash; to help them understand that there are choices here, and that they can (and should) have more control over their web experience than they do. Or, as many have pointed out, to make XULrunner more complete so startups can do their legitimate work and change the world in their own ways.</p>\n<p>These goals are all laudable. They&rsquo;re all important. They&rsquo;re all gigantic. So sometimes we make choices. Sometimes we go with the grain of the wood, so to speak, and try to spotlight great things that are happening in spite of any choices that &ldquo;we&rdquo; make.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll say this: the fact that this conversation is happening is a huge testament to the entire community &ndash; it means that Mozilla has relevance, that it&rsquo;s got an opportunity to continue to do amazing things.

				"content_text": "I've been thinking a lot the last few days about the debate that's been going on about what \"<a href=\"http://shaver.off.net/diary/2007/05/12/now-dont-take-this-the-wrong-way/\">Mozilla</a>\" should do. [I put \"Mozilla\" in quotes here because it's a quite unusual &amp; difficult to understand thing -- but the <a href=\"http://shaver.off.net/diary/2007/05/12/now-dont-take-this-the-wrong-way/\">link to Mike's post</a> is maybe the best articulation I've seen, especially when viewed through special, snark-reducing glasses. (I don't reduce the snark, personally -- it's what I like about Mike's posts.)] Or, rather, what Mozilla should <a href=\"http://www.allpeers.com/blog/2007/05/11/mozpad-a-mozilla-platform-user-group/\">do more of</a>, <a href=\"http://www.songbirdnest.com/node/1709\">do faster</a>, <a href=\"http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/05/10/thoughts-on-mozilla/\">do better</a>. They're all right, of course. We should do more, faster, and do it better. The criticisms in the debate, both explicit &amp; implicit, tend to create a lot of introspection &amp; wider debate, which I think, ultimately is good, healthy and productive. Even debates like <a href=\"http://john.jubjubs.net/2007/03/01/sigh-4/\">the one on languages</a> that pops up from time to time helps to clarify things.\n\nLike Mike, I'm having a tough time reconciling calls for centralized decision-making in something that's fundamentally decentralized. Even with Mozilla (Foundation + Corporation) making some decisions on where to put money or people to work, I believe we're still one of the most decentralized, global, egalitarian and successful technology/product organisms in the world. But more on that later...\n\nWhat I've been thinking about specifically this morning is the conversation about whether Mozilla (again, a loosely defined concept at best, but for the moment, let's assume that people mean Mozilla Corporation + Foundation) should focus on Firefox and whether we should focus on building a platform for application development. It's a bit of a false framing of the problem, though, and here's why: Firefox is, of course, an application that somewhere north of 100 million people in the world use to interact with the Internet. (and only around 50% of them use English language versions, which is a topic for another time.) But it also, today, is <em>3 separate and distinct platforms</em> for building applications on.\n\n1. It's XUL, of course, for building extensions -- and at last count, there are around 2,500 extensions that have been written that we know about that run the gamut from trivial to shockingly useful. These extensions work in the browser, and (mostly) make your browsing experience more productive. There are a number of startups who have built these -- several even using Firefox extensions as their initial or primary entry point. Some of the venture-backed (or angel-backed) ones that come immediately to mind are: <a href=\"http://del.icio.us\">del.icio.us</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com\">StumbleUpon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foxmarks.com\">FoxMarks</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jeteye.com\">JetEye</a>, <a href=\"http://www.yoono.com\">Yoono</a>, <a href=\"http://www.allpeers.com\">AllPeers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foxytunes.com\">FoxyTunes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.scribefire.com\">ScribeFire</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adaptiveblue.com\">AdaptiveBlue</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cooliris.com\">CoolIris</a> -- that's 10 quick ones, but there are many more that I've forgotten or not ever known about.\n\n2. It's a framework for building other applications that aren't within the browser -- commonly called (and grouped together) as something called XULRunner (or, more precisely, a collection of things which includes XULRunner, Gecko, and more). We're a little loose in what we call XULRunner, but here I'll just lump together applications that are using XUL as a platform to build more things that aren't browser-based on top of it (I know this is broader than most people's definition). Using XULRunner (or the Mozilla codebase) to build standalone apps (or derivative browsers) is so far quite popular among startups and large enterprises alike. Some of the venture-funded endeavors here are backed by the most successful VCs on the planet, and a brief, non-exhaustive list, includes <a href=\"http://www.joost.com\">Joost</a>, <a href=\"http://www.songbirdnest.com\">Songbird</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.flock.com\">Flock</a>, plus many more in stealth mode and behind corporate firewalls. And not to mention <a href=\"http://www.getthunderbird.com\">Thunderbird</a>, an e-mail client used by 5M+ people, and projects like <a href=\"http://www.caminobrowser.org/\">Camino</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/\">SeaMonkey</a> and the <a href=\"http://getdemocracy.com\">Democracy Player</a>, all of which are doing amazingly well.\n\n3. Most importantly, it's the web. In no small measure, the explosion of high interactivity AJAX applications can thank Firefox's emergence in 2004, both in terms of a good platform to develop on (and getting better, with fantastic extensions like <a href=\"http://www.getfirebug.com\">Firebug</a>), and in terms of the pressure that it's put on Microsoft to put out a better, more standards-oriented browser and do real development on the web again. These applications are uncountable -- thousands, or hundreds-of-thousands. Lots, anyway, and, as I said, resulting in 100M+ Firefox users, even before counting the positive impact on the 100s of millions of more IE users around the world.\n\nAnd while I'm on the subject of the open web, in our web-focused community, we keep talking about it like the fight is won. Like the web is open forever, for everyone. But it isn't. It isn't for, say, the 137M users in China, 99% of whom use IE-based browsers and are plagued by spyware -- most who I talked with figure all the malicious software on their computers is just the price of being on the Internet. It isn't for folks whose langage is Thai or Kurdish or Vietnamese -- or countless others -- who don't yet have a browser that's in their own language. It isn't for Koreans, where the overwhelming force of government and industry has <a href=\"http://www.kanai.net/weblog/archive/2007/01/26/00h53m55s\">built a Windows-oriented monoculture</a>.\n\nAnd it isn't, really, even with content. Flash is doing fantastically, driven by successes of companies like YouTube. And there are 3 major, potentially industry-changing efforts (Microsoft's Silverlight, Adobe's Apollo, Sun's JavaFX) to build new platforms that use words like open, but are as proprietary as Java ever was for Sun, and probably more so. They're all awesome technologies, and awesome demos. But they're not the open web. They're built by a vendor, controlled by a vendor, tooled by a vendor. And <a href=\"http://news.com.com/Adobe+ponies+up+for+Apollo/2100-1012_3-6129403.html\">Adobe's putting up $100M</a> -- significantly more than the wherewithal of a project like Mozilla -- to help companies take that first hit.\n\nThis isn't the most useful way to measure, but Mozilla has done this with fewer than 100 employees. We were fewer than half that a year ago, and more like 15 people total 2 years ago. This obviously and absolutely undercounts the whole of Mozilla -- 25%+ code for Firefox was contributed by volunteers; all non-English localizations were; and clearly the debate which I mentioned is involving many, many people in our extended world.\n\nSo here's a little summary. By my count, the absolute most conservative view is that 100 paid people are supporting more than a dozen funded startups building extensions for Firefox, more than a half dozen funded startups building completely new applications, countless web-based application startups, and <em>more than a million users per employee</em>. All for less money than Adobe is putting into Apollo's launch. Way less.\n\nThat's crazy high leverage. As much leverage as any organization I know of in the world.\n\nCan Mozilla do more? Yes. Can it go faster? Yes. Can Mozilla continue to support a giant ecosystem of enterprises built on top of Moz technology? Absolutely. Can Mozilla do everything? Save the world? Absolutely not. And, to be honest, nobody is more critical of Mozilla than people in our community. Far from being frustrating, it's actually amazing. Enabling. And it's the reason that Mozilla (in the large, not in the Foundation + Corporation sense) keeps moving forward, keeps making things better.\n\nWe do have to make choices, though. There's only so much time, there's only so much attention. It's tough for a small band of folks to change the world, and sometimes you do things in an order you may not like the best.\n\nBut some days we're faced with real, explicit choices. Like whether to ship Firefox 3 this year. Or how much time to devote to making sure that those aforementioned Thais can finally get a browser that actually works in their native language. Or how to help users in Dalian, users in Osaka, users in Great Falls, users in Ankara -- to help them understand that there are choices here, and that they can (and should) have more control over their web experience than they do. Or, as many have pointed out, to make XULrunner more complete so startups can do their legitimate work and change the world in their own ways.\n\nThese goals are all laudable. They're all important. They're all gigantic. So sometimes we make choices. Sometimes we go with the grain of the wood, so to speak, and try to spotlight great things that are happening in spite of any choices that \"we\" make.\n\nI'll say this: the fact that this conversation is happening is a huge testament to the entire community -- it means that Mozilla has relevance, that it's got an opportunity to continue to do amazing things. For a market that everyone, including me (well, everyone except the Mozilla community) thought was moribund just a few years ago, that's a special, maybe singular accomplishment. While there are real, contentious, meaty conversations happening about what \"Mozilla\" should do, we should all remember what an amazing set of things are happening already, and tomorrow, and the next day, too.\n",

I got to see Chip Heath talk at the <a href=\"http://dschool.stanford.edu\">d.school</a> last year and he was incredibly, super-compelling. Chip &amp; his brother have done a ton of research into what makes ideas \"sticky.\" That is, why do certain messages resonate with us while others you can hear over &amp; over &amp; over and not ever remember. They started by looking at urban legends -- maybe the stickiest messages we have around -- and found that a number of characteristics are common to each of the stories: they're simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional, and are stories. He also mentions that, in very many cases, the more you know about something, the less able you are to market it effectively: it's called the curs of knowledge. (Incidentally, my own view is that this is something that the Democratic Party in the US suffers from.)</p>This is a great book, and worth reading for anyone who wants to get their message across. (Here's a <a href=\"http://www.madetostick.com/thebook/excerpts.php\">link</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.madetostick.com/thebook/excerpts.php\">introductory chapter</a>.)\n",

(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_language\">wikipedia link</a>).\n\nfor reasons you can read about in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_language\">wikipedia article</a>, this has caused a stir on our message boards and e-mail lists -- there are exceptionally strong feelings both for and against.\n\nthe reason that this is discouraging to me should be obvious: education, access &amp; understanding are major parts (maybe the only parts) of making our world a better place to live. whether or not your neighbor has these things shouldn't be bad (or even neutral) to you -- it should be an imperative. it shouldn't be a negative to any one person that software exists (in whatever form) for someone else to use.\n\nthis has happened to us in other locales -- around the world, clearly, language is a proxy for a host of other cultural (and political and military) battles.\n\nbut my view is that making software (and other) information and software available to people to use &amp; repurpose however makes sense to them is incredibly important, and getting more so, and i'm proud to be part of an organization committed to it.\n\none of the folks here pointed out that this is the type of problem we want to have -- in other words, the fact that it matters so intensely to people means that what mozilla is doing, and what's happening on the Internet, is deeply important. but they're problems nonetheless.\n\nthe world feels increasingly small to me. in the past 6 months or so, i've been to china, japan and france to do work for mozilla, and am blown away by all the changes afoot.\n\nin related news, <a href=\"http://en.yeeyan.com/\">this</a> is a neat thing. it's a site that started by taking interesting US startup/venture blogs and translating them into Chinese -- now they're doing the same thing in reverse, to make it possible for english-speakers like me to read chinese articles about the startup world. completely amazing.\n\nanyone remember what life was like just 10 years ago? the memory for me is fading fast.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nI've really enjoyed having my Intel-based MacBook Pro this last year or so -- while it's a bit of a quirky machine and runs hotter than the sun, it's probably my favorite laptop I've ever had. One of the great things about it is virtualization -- the ability to run other operating systems as guest processes while still working in OSX.\n</p><p>\nWhy do I care? Well, maybe 4 reasons:\n</p><p>\n<strong>1) Quicken</strong> -- Quicken for Windows is <em>significantly </em>more feature-rich and less crashy than Quicken for OS X. I've gone back and forth on this one, have used Quicken in both environments a bunch, and just can't get happy with the OS X version. It's made a bigger problem lately by the lack of a Universal Binary, which means that it's running emulated (sloooooowwwww), and I find my machine running extra-strangely when Rosetta (the emulation layer) is running. (Apple, if you can release even a marginal spreadsheet tomorrow as part of iWork 07, my life will be a lot better. I know I'll still need Excel &amp; Word from time to time, but not nearly as much. Hmm. Maybe I'll post about that in another note.)\n</p><p>\n<strong>2) Firefox</strong> -- As Firefox is pretty much my bread and butter, and we run on (more than) Windows, Linux, and OS X, it's great to be able to flip over to Windows or Ubuntu or whatever to see how it works, test out issues that get reported by partners, that sort of thing.\n</p><p>\n<strong>3) Other new stuff</strong> -- Less frequent than previously, but every once in a while, something comes out that only runs on Windows. The Venice Project is a good example (that I'm going to experiment with and hopefully blog about later this week).\n</p><p>\n<strong>4) Remembering what Windows is like, and playing around with Vista</strong> -- as much as I like my current OS X operating environment (and I do, a lot -- it works the best of any system that I've ever used, really), it's important to remember that most of the world doesn't have the same experience (for lots of reasons, not just OS X). So I like periodically living in Windows XP or Vista for a bit of time so that I don't lose my muscle memory. Also interesting to play around with Ubuntu and notice what great strides they're making in terms of getting Linux to \"just work\" in lots of different cases.\n</p><p>\nI've been using Parallels for about 6 months now, and it works incredibly well. The team has built a program which gets better by the month, it seems. It's my virtualization of choice at the moment. I think the coherence feature is pretty bogus, even though the blogosphere is all excited about it. I find that in practice, it just doesn't work all that well. I will say that as good as Parallels is, and it's great, my machine always acts a little strangely when it's running.\n</p><p>\nVMWare Fusion, which is only a debug build at this point, is what I expect to start using eventually. It's <em>very </em>slow now -- because of the debug status -- but is a <em>lot </em>better behaved, lives better next to other applications, stays where you expect it. I'm pretty sure this will be the winner.\n</p><p>\nCrossver is, basically, unusable. Slooooooooowwww. And not really right. Neat that they can make it work. But when applications run, they make a <em>lot </em>of assumptions about the OS &amp; shell environment that they're in -- and if you don't have the whole package there to support it, there will always be weird gaps, no matter how much you implement. \n</p><p>\nAnd boot camp is good, too, but I just don't reboot my machine frequently enough for it to be practical. \n</p><p>\nAnyway, for the moment, it's Parallels, but I'm betting on VMWare before the summer.\n</p>\n",

I read Everitt's <em>Cicero </em>a while back and really enjoyed it. I've also read a few different accounts of the war between Caesar and Pompey that I've enjoyed. But I haven't read much about the period after Caesar's assassination as Octavian ruled with, then fought against Marc Antony to become Rome's first emperor. And even less about his actual reign. With <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/rome/\">HBO's Rome</a> starting up again next week, I was especially interested to read this book. Completely delivers -- loved the book. The bits about Octavian's early life aren't so great, but that's not much of the book. Things really start getting interesting when Caesar adopts Octavian, then even more interesting when Caesar is killed, and his former advisors clearly helped Octavian elevate into a triumvir position with Antony &amp; Lepidus. Hopefully the new HBO season will cover a bunch of this to reinforce it for me -- completely fascinating period in history -- a deeply republican society transforming into an imperial one, all the while using the poetry of the Republic. While Augustus was fairly cynical in his use of Republican rhetoric to develop his control of the empire, it turned out to be an incredibly good thing for the society -- providing a stability that hadn't been there in a hundred years. The parallels are too obvious not to notice, but I'm unsure what to learn from them. \n</p><p>\nAnyway, great great book.\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nKathy &amp; I have each been using the Nike+ipod system for our runs lately -- 2 gizmos: one that attaches to your running shoe, another that attaches to your nano. It adds some functionality to your ipod during runs -- a voice will interject when you've run 1K, 2K, 3K -- when you're halfway to your goal distance/time/etc. That by itself is really terrific, although it's not *as* important for me since I often run inside on treadmills. What's really cool is that my ipod stores information about my runs and automatically syncs it to the Nike web site:\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/Picture%208-1.png\"><img src=\"http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/Picture%208-1-tm.jpg\" height=\"400\" width=\"668\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Picture 8\" title=\"Picture 8\"></a>\n<br><span style=\"font-size:0;\">\n<br></span>Keeps track of all sorts of information -- the particular view above shows my run totals week-by-week since the end of October, when we started. (One beef I have with the site is that it's all in Flash -- not web native.) You can see that some weeks I did better than others -- like the week before Christmas, when things were pretty quiet around the office, as opposed to the week of Christmas, when Mom was here and Sam was a little under the weather.\n</p><p>\nWhat I find particularly useful, though, is goal setting. Here's a goal that I set a couple of weeks ago, to run 75 miles in 4 weeks:\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/Picture%209.png\"><img src=\"http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/Picture%209-tm.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"752\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Picture 9\" title=\"Picture 9\"></a><span style=\"font-size:0;\">\n<br>\n<br></span>I'm behind a bit -- because of the aforementioned Christmas week. I'll catch up a bunch today, but with my trip to China coming up, I'm betting I'm not quite going to get this one done. It's okay, though, as I find that the nike+ipod makes me <em>want</em> to run more, to run faster, to perform better. And my runs are getting longer &amp; faster as a result, in measurable ways. (There is a funny counter-effect -- the times when I forget to bring your ipod, I'm much less motivated to run hard or far, as I don't get \"credit\" -- Kathy's noticed the same thing for her. A related effect, I think, is that I've been doing more running compared to lifting weights than previously -- again, I think it's the psychological issue of getting credit.) I also find myself, once I've set a goal (of, say 8 miles or a 10K), that even if I'm tired, I generally power through and finish. The other day I mis-entered a run of 2 miles longer than I wanted to run -- but instead of stopping when I had intended, I took it as a challenge to run a little bit further. \n</p><p>\nAnyway, this is turning out to be an extremely useful &amp; fulfilling thing for both Kathy &amp; me. Makes me start thinking about what other parts of our lives will start/continue to be metered. (Kathy &amp; I used something like this called a SportBrain a few years ago, but this is a lot lot better.)\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\n<img src=\"http://www.cingular.com/global/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/blackberrypearl8100_l.gif\" align=\"left\">A couple of weeks before Christmas, Dad helped me procure a Blackberry Pearl for my Cingular account. Of late I've been a \"just a phone\" person, with the small form factor Razr, but, as usual, the Motorola UI has been driving me incredibly, incredibly crazy. How can they make UIs that bad? It's a mystery to me. Before that, I had a Treo, which I liked quite a bit, except for the large size of the phone, the antenna nub, and the crashiness, which has become the defining feature of Palm devices over the last few years. The UI, though, was tremendous. I had avoided getting sucked into the Blackberry/Crackberry vortex for a long time -- not because I don't like e-mail on my phone (I like it well enough), but because I felt like the devices weren't much fun, and had pretty crummy interfaces (except for the scroll wheel, which is pretty handy). \n</p><p>\nAnyhoo, my new Pearl is *great*. A terrific device -- both in terms of data access and as a phone. The trackball, small as it is, is fantastic -- and feels better on my aging (see: January 9; wrong side of 35) thumb muscles. The screen is really bright and attractive. It's *really* small -- just about the same size as my Razr was. And the UI isn't bad. Plus it's got more consumery features like a camera (other folks at work don't care about but I like having from time to time). The keyboard works great for me -- two letters on a key seems strange, but it's not at all difficult to get used to. I think that when they release the new models in a year or so (the Crimson, which is the same slimness, and has a camera, but is marginally wider to accommodate a full keyboard) I'll move back to a full keyboard, but for now I couldn't be happier with the phone.\n</p>\n",

I know that it's not in good taste to complain about the 3 days of the year when I have to scrape ice, but there it is. \n</p><p>\n---\n</p><p>\nOh, and <a href=\"http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/home.do?source=shocom_nav\">Dexter</a> just finished last night. Great show. Michael C Hall was tops.\n</p><p>\nDidn't mention it last week, but <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/?ntrack_para1=leftnav_category0_show1\">The Wire Season 4</a> also finished up and was totally magnificent. As others have said, it was the best season of the best show ever on TV. Just about perfect television.\n</p>\n",

I've been an Amazon customer for a long time now -- since 1996 -- but just think that in spite of the high quality of service, I don't have much alignment with them as a company. Powell's is harder to order from -- they don't have \"one-click\", for example, due to Amazon's heinous patent strategy -- but maybe that just proves the point for me. I also like the idea of making used books as easy to buy as new books, which Powell's clearly has a stronger commitment to than Amazon. I'll let you know how it goes.

It's a non-fiction account of a 25 year old Stanford grad posing for a whole year as a high school senior in Southern California. It's a fine book, but I think the idea is a little better than the execution (sort of like \"Heroes\" on NBC). Lots of party drugs, steroids &amp; hooking up. Not quite like my own <a href=\"http://www.neisd.net/mac/\">high school</a> experience, but close enough to what I imagine it's like today. Punch line seems to be that high school's tough &amp; full of drama, educators are winging it a little bit in an environment of too-much-influence by school districts and politicians, and lots of things happen for lots of random reasons.\n</p>\n",

The idea is that sometimes you just need a little extra oomph to stay in your run or kick it up a notch. I'm not going to tell you what my powersong is -- it's embarrassingly teenybopper. But that's sort of not the point. It works for me, and that's what's important. \n</p><p>\nWhat I realized on my run today was that my library board meeting, which I blogged about this morning, was sort of a powersong for me -- gave me an extra motivational boost. Reminded me to focus in on the things that matter. That's pretty neat. \n</p><p>\nSo now I'm trying to notice what my other powersongs are. I'll notice a couple of them again as soon as I get out of here and get home for the evening.\n</p><p>\nDo you know what your powersongs are?\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nLast night I had my monthly meeting for the City of Sunnyvale Library Board -- as I've noted before, I'm really happy to serve in this capacity for the community, but very often the meetings aren't exactly wall-to-wall action. Last night in particular, I was feeling a little bit mopey. I've got a bad feeling about how today's elections are going to turn out (and if an election in circumstances like this can't turn out better than the last few years then I don't know what to think), and I was even a little bummed filling out my California ballot -- lots of foregone conclusions in the elections for people (strangely, somehow I didn't even know that Diane Feinstein was <em>running</em> -- that seems sort of pathetic, but it's imminently clear that she had things sewn up way before the election even started) -- and a dizzying number (13) of poorly-written, confusing and misleading ballot initiatives. \n</p><p>\nBut when I got to our meeting (held in the actual library this month instead of council chambers, where it is normally), the doors were still locked, so I walked around the library for a while. Our library, I should say. And it was amazing. People who write that libraries aren't relevant today don't pay much attention, I don't guess, because the library was <em>filled </em>with all sorts of people from Sunnyvale. Adults, teens, kids -- it reminded me what a vibrant public place the library is, and why it's important. We can go all post-modern -- and I do that as much as anyone -- and talk about how the Internet is making information access ubiquitous, and how the Wikipedia is making encyclopedias irrelevant, and places like Starbucks with easy WiFi are making third spaces like libraries less meaningful. \n</p><p>\nBut here's the thing: it's just untrue. \n</p><p>\nMany, many people go to libraries to get together with others. To be by themselves. To find editorial voices. To get the help of librarians. Many, many reason. To have these conversations in the context of books, media &amp; information -- and to have the conversations in an environment where learning, finding &amp; growing is a value in &amp; of itself. \n</p><p>\nAnd in the meeting itself, my feelings were reinforced. About a dozen members of the community came to the meeting to listen, participate &amp; discuss. A few folks came by and stayed the whole 2 hour meeting just to let us know that when an issue possibly comes up before the City Council in the next year or two, it matters a lot to them. Or, I should say, to the effort that they're <em>volunteering </em>for -- keeping some library services open for about 24 hours a week that only a few folks take advantage of each week. It's not important to them because of some price/performance study, or some monetization plan, or any of the things that we routinely talk about here in Silicon Valley. It's important to them because providing this service through volunteers is <em>meaningful</em> to members of our community. That's it. \n</p><p>\nThere's a lot more that I thought about during the meeting last night, and a lot of other things came up, but when I got home I was feeling much better -- incredibly better, really. Because for all the problems we've got in this community, in this state, in this country, we've got a <em>culture of participation </em>baked into our DNA. When people participate, it's often loud, messy &amp; confusing -- but, in general, things get better. Because participation means that we're all making things our own. \n</p><p>\nIt was really inspiring for me. There were so many reminders that, at the end of the day, the idea that we all have not just the privilege of participating, but the <em>right </em>to participate -- one that's so far lasted more than 227 years -- is a brilliant, hopeful ray of sunshine. \n</p><p>\nSo vote. \n</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>\n<img src=\"http://www.getdemocracy.com/images/img_screen.jpg\">\n</p><p>\nOver the last couple of months, I've gotten to know Nicholas Reville, one of the founders of the <a href=\"http://www.pcf.org\">Participatory Culture Foundation</a>. They're a non-profit near Boston who make a set of incredibly cool software, notably the <a href=\"http://www.getdemocracy.com\">Democracy Player</a>. Works on Windows/Mac/Linux &amp; is one of my very favorite new applications -- think of it, loosely, as cable television with a zillion channels mashed up with your computer. More specifically, it's a video player that lets you subscribe to Internet video channels -- delivered over FTP, BitTorrent or other transports -- and every time there's a new clip or episode, the Player knows to go download it in the background -- they show up in the player sort of like e-mails do.\n</p><p>\nThey also make some software to let you broadcast videos, plus some rating &amp; channel guide pieces.\n</p><p>\nFor example, I subscribe to a couple of over-the-Internet shows -- one's called <em>The Angry Chef </em>and the other is <em>Ze Frank. The Angry Chef </em>is a terrific 20ish minute cooking show that the cook produces every once in a while. <em>Ze Frank </em>is a daily 4 minute comic sketch sort of like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert (sort of). <em>The Angry Chef </em>is a very high quality show -- both in terms of content and video quality (much better than you can stream online).\n</p><p>\nHere's the best bit from a consumer point of view: videos that I'm interested in just show up when they're ready. No action required. (There are some cool search capabilities in the 0.9.1 along with downloading, so that you can go to, say YouTube to search for videos on the Dallas Cowboys -- it'll monitor for new stuff and let you download &amp; organize when new ones are posted.)\n</p><p>\nHere's the best bit from a producer's point of view: you can put up video very easily yourself, without paying the onramp toll of iTunes or going through the loss of control of something like YouTube. It should be easy for Kathy &amp; me to put up SamTV -- including putting up HD quality (if we ever get an HD camcorder).\n</p><p>\nIn the large, it changes everything. Fundamentally democratizes video <em>distribution</em>, in a way that's analogous to how free tools are lowering barriers to video production incredibly rapidly. In spite of my <a href=\"http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/2006/10/youtube.html\">previous post</a> (which I still believe), I think that YouTube &amp; iTunes video &amp; iMovie even ABC are changing the state of video incredibly quickly now, which is good. It's always been a tougher medium to work in than, say, photography, but it's getting easier now along several axes.\n</p><p>\nBut here's the really important bit: video is too visceral, too important, too <em>human, </em>to allow production &amp; distribution to get funneled through just one or two or even half a dozen \"authoritative sources\". The folks at PCF have put together what I think is a visionary new type of application to show the way.\n</p><p>\nGetting to know Nicholas over the past few weeks has really gotten me thinking more about it, and I'm convinced that I want to help. So I'm joining the Board of Directors &amp; hope to do my part now -- <a href=\"http://www.getdemocracy.com\">check it out</a>.\n</p>\n",

This book is about a poor black kid in Memphis who happened to grow up, find an affluent white sponsor, enroll in an almost exclusively white Memphis evangelical Bible school, and play starting left tackle for Ole Miss in his freshman year, and will almost certainly be one of the top 10 draft picks next year for the NFL. Oh, and when he was sixteen, he was 6'5\" and 330 lbs. Yikes.\n</p><p>\nAnyway, interesting &amp; inspirational story, if a little full of hyperbole here &amp; there. Also tells why the left tackle, a position that nobody ever notices, is the <em>second highest paid position in professional football. </em>No joke. They make more than running backs. Crazy.\n</p><p>\nInteresting book for the human interest story, and a little bit for the football economics. But not as great as <em>Moneyball.</em>\n</p>\n",

(He's got a new one out called <em>A Spot of Bother </em>that's on my night-stand patiently waiting for me to get through my new McCarthy &amp; Murakami &amp; Maeda &amp; Tufte &amp; Woodward books. Yay!)\n</p><p>\nAnyway, I wasn't really sure what to make of this book when I started -- couldn't really tell whether it was fiction or not (honestly). \n</p><p>\nIt turns out to be quite real -- a biographical account of a homeless person in Cambridge, England -- \"chaotic homeless\" as Stuart calls himself. It's a bit of an inside-out book, in that it tells the story of Stuart's present-day life, but is interspersed with chapters describing earlier periods in his development, going backwards in time. So he gets progressively less screwed up and, in turn, more and more empathetic a character, until you get back to his very childhood. (Which, as you might expect was not perfect, although he never had a coat hanger in his eye, or at least not a documented one.)\n</p><p>\nAnyway, I really liked this book. It's not like any other that I've read, and it's such an authentic, careful, well-told story that I think it's impossible not to get a lot out of reading it. \n</p><p>\nContrast that to <em>State of Denial, </em>by Bob Woodward, which I'm reading right now. A lot like popcorn -- easy to eat. Popcorn that kills your spirit, makes you feel dirty and gross, and wonder how the hell this guy ever got elected in the first (and 2nd) place. You know, like popcorn with that grody movie butter on it. \n</p>\n",

(It's ironic that Steinbeck worked with the agencies that would become the CIA &amp; such, given that he was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck\">branded as a communist/socialist</a> by many in our government in years following.)\n</p><p>\nAnyway, the book was clearly written with an agenda here, and it's easy to tell that. But I enjoyed it nonetheless; very good empathy with both populations, I thought. This book was translated by the resistance in many many countries in Europe during the war -- it had a material impact on the movement in Norway &amp; other regions. (He even received the Hakkon medal in Norway after the war.)\n</p><p>\nI'm glad to have read it -- it's unusual for a Steinbeck work for sure.\n</p>\n",

We \"lucked\" into seeing a duet between Xena (Warrior Princess) and Smokey Robinson, followed up by a ghastly country song sung by Randy Travis and Cheech Marin (pictured above) about digging up some sort of bones. I could feel the life force leeching out of me just being in the room with it on. Funniest bit (in sort of a sad way) that we saw in 10 minutes or so was one of the judges, Marie Osmond, telling someone that he sounded \"a little too white\" on his song. Wow. You can't make that stuff up.\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nSo far, driving a hybrid has been an interesting experience for me. the first \"aha\" that I'm finding is that there are so many indicators and reminders of fuel consumption that I consciously try to drive a little bit less like an idiot than I did in my last car. I find myself taking corners more slowly, accelerating a little bit less quickly from a stop, and generally trying to coast more on the highway. \n</p><p>\nThat's all resulted in sometimes peculiar driving habits, to be sure. But probably overall safer, and surely more fuel-efficient. \n</p><p>\nBuying a hybrid SUV has meant that we haven't seen incredible gas mileage so far -- more in the range of 26-28 mpg -- which is 50% better than my A4, but still not what you'd call world-beating. \n</p><p>\nThe other interesting thing I've seen noted elsewhere: inside the car it's just much more often quiet than in other cars. Riding around in Kathy's TL (which we previously felt was pretty darn quiet) now feels pretty \"rumbly\" to me all the time. Just need to watch out for pedestrians. (I get a *lot* of looks in parking lots when we're backing out -- pretty much always silent since it's on electric motors.)\n</p><p>\nAnyway, so far so good -- it's hard to say in 2006 that there's ever a time when we forget about our oil-dependence -- but I think I'm glad to be driving more mindful of it.\n</p>\n",

Most great catastrophes tend to be relatively local -- an explosion will devastate an awesome number of city blocks here, a fire will wreck a neighborhood there, a flood will inundate the lower-lying parts of a town, terrorists will wreak mayhem in a crowded urban quarter. But once in a mercifully rare while there are those events that enfold and ruin in full the complex engine work that is an established, fully developed urban society. The dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are among the most obvious. The Great Fire of London in 1666. The Black Death. The wartime destruction of Berlin and Dresden. the volcanic ruin of Santorini, of Pompeii and Herculaneum, and Merinique's St. Piere. The huge eatrhquakes in Lisbon and Tangshan -- and then, in 1906, in San Francisco.\n<br>\n<br>the biggest of these cities survived. The smaller communities -- Pompeii and St. Pierre, for example -- lost their raison d'etre once their buildings were gone, once their monuments were buried and their byways obliterated. but the world's big cities generally exist for reasons that go far beyond the accumulation of buildings that is their outward manifestation. Their presence in the place they occupy is invariably due to come combination of geography - they lie by a river crossing, in a bay of refuge, at the mouth of a mountain pass -- and of climate, together with some vague and indefinable organic reason that persuades humankind to settle there.\n<br>\n<br>Trials of any kind -- war, pestilence, natural or human violence, with wholesale death or total physical destruction, or both, being the harshest of all -- may slow that growth or cause some other setback; but such things are just setbacks, and before long the original reasons for a city's existence reassert themselves. Life returns, buildings and roads are rebuilt, new monuments spring up or old ones are found and dusted off, and before long the city returns to its old self, ready to see what more fate can hurl at it, to challenge and strengthen and temper its will to survive. It may not always entirely regain its predisaster status -- San Francisco had to cede much to Los Angeles, for example. But generally, so far as their respective quiddities are concerned, great cities always recover.\n<br>\n<br>...So whether it is Manhattan, Falluja, Warsaw, Coventry, or Hiroshima, it seems true that though cities may on occasion lose their heart, they seldom also lose their soul; and San Francisco was no exception. All that its shattered, wearied, and suddenly impoverished citizens needed was leadership, someone to take charge, someone to lift the demoralizing burdens of wreck and ruin from their shoulders and show them the possibilities of remaking the place that they had called their home.\n</blockquote>\n",

A couple of weeks ago, I wanted to sell our old CRT television, so I put up a listing on Craig's List. Within 2 hours, I had <em>eight</em> offers for it, so I just got back in touch with the quickest response -- a guy named Bob Brown, who lives in Los Altos. \n</p><p>\nAnyway, he came over -- the TV was in our garage, so I couldn't really plug it into a video source, but asked he wanted me to turn it on -- he said: \"Sure, might as well see the raster.\" My nerd antennae went up just a little bit. (To be honest, that's not a terribly unusual thing to hear in SV, just moderately.)\n</p><p>\nThen he mentioned he had recently bought a TV for his son that he had fixed up (\"it was just a bum IC -- easy to fix.\") Right.\n</p><p>\n\"What's your background?\" I asked. Electrical Engineer. Well, duh. Stanford guy. Worked for Atari. Oh, and he <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong\">invented Pong</a></em>. Right. Cool! \n</p><p>\nHe didn't actually invent Pong, but he's the engineering lead who took it from being a stand up arcade game to being the game with paddles that we all had in our houses. We talked for a while about Breakout, my favorite (him: \"...and then when you broke through to the top of the blocks -- orgasmic!\")\n</p><p>\nGreat, fun conversation. Totally blown away by the guy. And I avoided asking him the \"how much LSD did it take\" question that kept trying to get out. \n</p><p>\nSo Silicon Valley is great that way.

				"content_text": "<p>\nObviously, blogging seems to be a nervous twitch for me when I'm in an audience -- I have a hard time focusing 100% on presentations, but find doing actual work-related...um...work to be too distracting for me to get anything out of the presentations. So I'm blogging for a bit. TV thougths:\n</p><p>\n- Survivor finale last night was boring boring boring. Aras is the worst winner ever: I'm #2! But worth a million bucks now. Shane was a funny guy. Crazy, but funny. I'll probably keep watching, but it's getting a little tired.\n</p><p>\n- The West Wing finale was pretty lame, I thought. Some nice moments, but mostly the echoes of the great moments of the series, no great moments themselves. \"Bartlett for America\" remembered the start of the first campaign. President giving the Constitution to Charlie remembered the Thanksgiving episode when he gave him his family's carving knife. But it did remind me that deep down inside, I want to believe in our government and leaders. I want someone in the Oval Office (and Sacramento, and over on Olive Ave in Sunnyvale, for that matter) who I can be inspired by, who can govern, who makes me proud to be American. Maybe that's a remnant of another time, but it's what I'd like.\n</p><p>\n- Lost is <em>awesome. </em>What a great show. I don't know who that Alvo Hansar dude is, but he had a bunch of cool stuff back in 1980. \n</p><p>\n- Thief was a good show. Sadly, gone. But means that Rescue Me is about to start, and that's definitely good.\n</p><p>\n- (I know this is radio, but \"Wait Wait Don't Tell Me\" was super-funny this week, with Tom Hanks telling them to Go to Hell. (they were making jokes that he's the nicest guy in Hollywood.) But my favorite part was when they were recounting that W said last week that the high point, for him, of his presidency was catching a 7 1/2 pound fish of some sort or other. Roy Blount, Jr said: \"You know, I think he's right.\"\n</p><p>\n- We're 3 episodes behind on Big Love. That's not a bad sign -- sometimes happens to us with HBO shows. Can't decide if I like it or not yet, but it's creepy.\n</p><p>\n- The season finale of The Office was pitch perfect. But a painful break point. I was really skeptical about the US version, but not anymore. It's terrific.\n</p><p>\n- I find myself wanting to watch The Colbert Report more than The Daily Show. Sort of shocking. I thought Colbert was going to get boring quickly, but it hasn't. Weird. I'm pretty sure it's the most respected news source in America today. Books didn't tell me that -- that's what my <em>gut </em>tells me.\n</p><p>\n- Sopranos is good. Lots of foreshadowing. But I'm really geared up about Deadwood coming back. They say it could be the last season, which would be both a bummer, and potentially great, since it would give them crazy creative freedom. Sort of like The Wire, except that that ended up not being the last season. I'm both scared &amp; excited for The Wire to return. not sure what to expect.\n</p><p>\n- Last, I could not possibly have any higher expectations for Studio 60, the new show from Aaron Sorkin. They got maxed out last night when I found out Brad Whitford will be on the show. How did Josh go from the White House to an improv show in LA? Did he get fired as the President's Chief of Staff? Maybe we'll find out next season, until he's eventually replaced with Josh Malina. (sort of an Aaron Sorkin in joke.)\n</p><p>\nAnd that'll wrap it up from day 1 of my OpenAjax get-together experience. I'm going to endeavor to pay more attention tomorrow, so less blogging. Probably enough for a while, anyway.\n</p>\n",

Let me just say this: Spain in the 1400s really sucked. A lot. Unless you were Catholic, I suppose, in which case you got a bunch of free stuff, gold &amp; buildings from all of the Moors, Jews and other miscellaneous heretics who were expelled or, um, expelled with extreme prejudice. In the States, we have a bit of a fascination with our own history (\"In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue...\" You know the story.)\n</p><p>\nAnyway, with the stories of discovery of America, we tend to focus on things on our side of the world, and if we're lucky, occasionally even recognizes the fact that there were folks here before Europeans \"found\" the place. Everyone knows, of course, that Columbus first found the continent in 1492, and was backed by the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella. But there was a <em>lot </em>of other stuff that was happening in Europe at the time, and Spain was ground zero. A war of succession had happened before the two married and joined Aragon &amp; Castile. Crazy divorces &amp; new churches getting started in England. A <em>horribly corrupt papacy </em>by Rodrigo Borgia. \n</p><p>\nAnd, of course, the campaign by the Spanish against the Moorish society living in Spain, of which, mostly, Boabdil the Unfortunate was the leader. [That's a tough name to give a kid. Boabdil would be hard enough, without his parents tacking \"the Unfortunate\" on there. \"Sam the Unfortunate\" would have been tough for our kiddo. My favorite monarch name since \"Ethelred the Unready.\" I bet he got beat up a lot in school.]\n</p><p>\nOf course, the Spanish won. But told the Moors they could stay. They were busy giving the Jews a choice to either convert to Catholicism or leave Spain. Or torturing other Spaniards to give the dirt on folks who weren't acting Catholic enough. The confiscated property of the departed Jews is generally considered to have been the funding that allowed Columbus' voyage. So they mostly moved all the Jews out. Oh, right -- then they decided they didn't actually want Moors, either, so went back on their promises to that population.\n</p><p>\nI liked this book -- it helped me to connect some of the big picture historical events in my mind. Maybe it's obvious to others, but it wasn't clear to me that the Spanish Inquisition was contemporaneous with Columbus' discovery of America, or that it really enabled that discovery. I didn't like it as much as his previous book, <em>Warriors of God</em>, about Richard the Lionheart &amp; the Third Crusade, but still worth reading. \n</p>\n",

Most great catastrophes tend to be relatively local -- an explosion will devastate an awesome number of city blocks here, a fire will wreck a neighborhood there, a flood will inundate the lower-lying parts of a town, terrorists will wreak mayhem in a crowded urban quarter. But once in a mercifully rare while there are those events that enfold and ruin in full the complex engine work that is an established, fully developed urban society. The dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are among the most obvious. The Great Fire of London in 1666. The Black Death. The wartime destruction of Berlin and Dresden. the volcanic ruin of Santorini, of Pompeii and Herculaneum, and Merinique's St. Piere. The huge eatrhquakes in Lisbon and Tangshan -- and then, in 1906, in San Francisco.\n<br>\n<br>the biggest of these cities survived. The smaller communities -- Pompeii and St. Pierre, for example -- lost their raison d'etre once their buildings were gone, once their monuments were buried and their byways obliterated. but the world's big cities generally exist for reasons that go far beyond the accumulation of buildings that is their outward manifestation. Their presence in the place they occupy is invariably due to come combination of geography - they lie by a river crossing, in a bay of refuge, at the mouth of a mountain pass -- and of climate, together with some vague and indefinable organic reason that persuades humankind to settle there. \n<br>\n<br>Trials of any kind -- war, pestilence, natural or human violence, with wholesale death or total physical destruction, or both, being the harshest of all -- may slow that growth or cause some other setback; but such things are just setbacks, and before long the original reasons for a city's existence reassert themselves. Life returns, buildings and roads are rebuilt, new monuments spring up or old ones are found and dusted off, and before long the city returns to its old self, ready to see what more fate can hurl at it, to challenge and strengthen and temper its will to survive. It may not always entirely regain its predisaster status -- San Francisco had to cede much to Los Angeles, for example. But generally, so far as their respective quiddities are concerned, great cities always recover.\n<br>\n<br>...So whether it is Manhattan, Falluja, Warsaw, Coventry, or Hiroshima, it seems true that though cities may on occasion lose their heart, they seldom also lose their soul; and San Francisco was no exception. All that its shattered, wearied, and suddenly impoverished citizens needed was leadership, someone to take charge, someone to lift the demoralizing burdens of wreck and ruin from their shoulders and show them the possibilities of remaking the place that they had called their home.\n</blockquote>\n",

For me, it brings to mind the phrase: \"When all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" Sam's a total crackup -- generally he knows exactly when to use \"hi\" -- when I walk in the door, when he sees us in the morning, when he meets someone new. (When he meets <em>everyone</em>, actually, new or old, and even some stuffed animals and birds outside.)\n</p><p>\nBut the funniest thing is that sometimes we'll be playing or having dinner, and he'll start talking in his babbling mode. Actually, it's not really babbling, but more intentional word formation (he's really working on \"b\" words at the moment, including, but not limited to: bird, bath, bottle, ball, baby, bye-bye). So he'll say something to you that sounds more or less like a sentence, and you'll say \"what??,\" and he'll say something again, and you'll go \"huh?\". And then he'll say \"hi!\" And pretty much he'll get what he wants. \"Hi\" is his hammer of the moment, and it's a pretty good one.\n</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m at an industry meeting today about AJAX &ndash; basically the collection of technologies on the client and the server (but generally thought of mostly as DHTML &amp; Javascript) that most web companies are building out richer applications mostly delivered via web browser. Google&rsquo;s GMail started this trend in earnest (you can quibble here), but today there&rsquo;s a ton of interactivity in web applications that just wasn&rsquo;t there a year or two ago. Mozilla generally and Firefox specifically have had a big impact here, as the development (and especially debugging) experience on Firefox for AJAX-style applications is significantly better than with any other browser, at least for the moment.</p>\n<p>Anyway. The first thing I&rsquo;ll say is that we&rsquo;re in this awesome building pretty close to where the Giants play in San Francisco &ndash; used to be the Macromedia building but is now, of course, the Adobe building. It&rsquo;s really a terrific building: old brick, exposed timbers &amp; beams &ndash; pretty much vintage SF Web 1.0 Bubble. :-)  <em><strong>But</strong></em> there&rsquo;s no friggin' open wireless network. What the heck? Are we back in 2004 or something? Ugh. So.</p>\n<p>But what I really wanted to post about in this particular missive is how much things have changed, truly, and how much technology, for all its foibles, is incredibly more user-centered than it was when I was at Stanford, or Trilogy, or even Apple, really. Back in 1990, Mitch Kapor wrote something called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Software Design Manifesto <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I&rsquo;ll link to the article sometime when I can connect). What he basically asserted is that the software industry (which had just witnessed the release of Windows 3.0 &ndash; craptastic!! Now, improved with LanMan!) needed a new role that was analogous to a building architect (or urban planner, some others posited) &ndash; someone to think about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->human use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of software products. This was an important thought, and his essay was the first one that I read when I embarked on my work in HCI.</p>\n<p>[Hmm. Gartner guy just noted an issue with Firefox 1.5.0.2 displaying GMail. Uh oh. Everyone in the room swiveled their heads to look at me. Hi, I&rsquo;m the Firefox guy. In the orange shirt. Hard to miss.]</p>\n<p>[Aside: this talk is veering pretty wildly back &amp; forth between enterprise &amp; consumer applications, and can I just say this: Oh my god. Enterprise is sleep inducing. I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve spent half my career to date working on enterprise. Thank goodness for the other half &ndash; the consumer half. I&rsquo;m glad that I understand how to operate in both worlds, but man. Yawn.]</p>\n<p>Anyway, even 5 years after Mitch wrote that essay, when I went to Trilogy, HCI was considered a slightly wacky discipline. I managed to convince Joe (our CEO) that HCI mattered for Trilogy. (Probably true. Hard to say. Long, but boring story, as the aside above suggests.) I spent time working on it at Apple. And occasionally companies would hire us to help them with it at Reactivity. But it was always a bit of a hard sell, and I think most people viewed it as a discipline that was somehow separate from the technology or business activities that companies were working on.</p>\n<p>Now, though, it&rsquo;s different. With both consumer and enterprise software, it seems to me that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everyone <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talks about the user experience, about how getting it right is crucial to application adoption, and application adoption is the thing that matters, either in getting a return on your investment in the enterprise or in getting consumers to use your service. It&rsquo;s an interesting, and fundamental shift, seems to me. We&rsquo;re getting to the point now where technology is still a little wonky, but at least the conversations mostly include at least putative normal human beings and ideas about how they&rsquo;re going to use our work. That&rsquo;s a great step forward.</p>\n<p>But I think it&rsquo;s more fundamental than that.

				"content_text": "I'm at an industry meeting today about AJAX -- basically the collection of technologies on the client and the server (but generally thought of mostly as DHTML &amp; Javascript) that most web companies are building out richer applications mostly delivered via web browser. Google's GMail started this trend in earnest (you can quibble here), but today there's a ton of interactivity in web applications that just wasn't there a year or two ago. Mozilla generally and Firefox specifically have had a big impact here, as the development (and especially debugging) experience on Firefox for AJAX-style applications is significantly better than with any other browser, at least for the moment.\n\nAnyway. The first thing I'll say is that we're in this awesome building pretty close to where the Giants play in San Francisco -- used to be the Macromedia building but is now, of course, the Adobe building. It's really a terrific building: old brick, exposed timbers &amp; beams -- pretty much vintage SF Web 1.0 Bubble. :-)  ***But*** there's no friggin' open wireless network. What the heck? Are we back in 2004 or something? Ugh. So.\n\nBut what I really wanted to post about in this particular missive is how much things have changed, truly, and how much technology, for all its foibles, is incredibly more user-centered than it was when I was at Stanford, or Trilogy, or even Apple, really. Back in 1990, Mitch Kapor wrote something called <em>A Software Design Manifesto </em>(I'll link to the article sometime when I can connect). What he basically asserted is that the software industry (which had just witnessed the release of Windows 3.0 -- craptastic!! Now, improved with LanMan!) needed a new role that was analogous to a building architect (or urban planner, some others posited) -- someone to think about <em>human use </em>of software products. This was an important thought, and his essay was the first one that I read when I embarked on my work in HCI.\n\n[Hmm. Gartner guy just noted an issue with Firefox 1.5.0.2 displaying GMail. Uh oh. Everyone in the room swiveled their heads to look at me. Hi, I'm the Firefox guy. In the orange shirt. Hard to miss.]\n\n[Aside: this talk is veering pretty wildly back &amp; forth between enterprise &amp; consumer applications, and can I just say this: Oh my god. Enterprise is sleep inducing. I can't believe I've spent half my career to date working on enterprise. Thank goodness for the other half -- the consumer half. I'm glad that I understand how to operate in both worlds, but man. Yawn.]\n\nAnyway, even 5 years after Mitch wrote that essay, when I went to Trilogy, HCI was considered a slightly wacky discipline. I managed to convince Joe (our CEO) that HCI mattered for Trilogy. (Probably true. Hard to say. Long, but boring story, as the aside above suggests.) I spent time working on it at Apple. And occasionally companies would hire us to help them with it at Reactivity. But it was always a bit of a hard sell, and I think most people viewed it as a discipline that was somehow separate from the technology or business activities that companies were working on.\n\nNow, though, it's different. With both consumer and enterprise software, it seems to me that <em>everyone </em>talks about the user experience, about how getting it right is crucial to application adoption, and application adoption is the thing that matters, either in getting a return on your investment in the enterprise or in getting consumers to use your service. It's an interesting, and fundamental shift, seems to me. We're getting to the point now where technology is still a little wonky, but at least the conversations mostly include at least putative normal human beings and ideas about how they're going to use our work. That's a great step forward.\n\nBut I think it's more fundamental than that. In my admittedly mostly homogenous circle of friends (nerds, all of us), the things that people get most excited about anymore are things like videos of Stephen Colbert online or experiences like World of Warcraft or open media like political bloggers or just places to interact like MySpace or Facebook. The technology matters -- is critical, in fact -- but it's less often <em>the point </em>of what people are working on. And HCI seems to me to be blending into the fabric of the development &amp; business teams instead of standing as a separate discipline (this is a super-long conversation and it's more complicated than what I just wrote, but the gist is true.).\n\n[Another side note: most startup guys that I talk with lately have MacBooks -- it's sort of the uniform of the moment here. But in this room, it's probably more like 60% Windows machines and only 40% MacBooks. I think it's maybe because a lot of these folks are in enterprise environments.]\n",

(goes without saying, but kathy's becoming a pretty incredible photographer (in particular, of kids), and it's fun to see her evolve. less fun to figure out how to back up 12,000 incredibly important pictures regularly, but oh well.)\n</p><p>\nbefore sam was born, we picked up a point &amp; shoot: the sony dsc-t7, which is what i've been traveling with lately, and in particular, what i've taken pictures of tokyo &amp; paris with. it's an <em>incredible </em>piece of packaging: super-small, really light -- easy to put into your shirt pocket. but we've never really been happy with it: the colors always seem a little washed out, and, worse, it was a pretty slow lens, which made it tough to take pictures indoors without flash or really terrible blur. i had to throw away a ton of my pictures taken with the camera because the blur was just too much. \n</p><p>\nso last week we picked up the new canon sd700is, which has the same image stabilization technology (marketing-wise, i mean) that kathy's canon zoom lens has. reduces shake in low light, and so far takes fantastically good pictures, which we're really happy with. i'll probably post a few side-by-side comparisons as I start to spend more time with the new camera. it's a little bulkier than the old one -- mostly for housing the 4x zoom lens -- but i think that there may be a lens size/package size versus photo quality tradeoff that may not ever go away. \n</p><p>\nanyway, here's one of the first pics i took with the new camera (sam's about ready to escape the high chair, so is glaring at me a bit while i screw around with the camera): \n</p><p>\n<a href=\"http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/IMG_0008.JPG\"><img src=\"http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/IMG_0008-tm.jpg\" height=\"400\" width=\"533\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"IMG_0008.JPG\" title=\"IMG_0008.JPG\"></a>\n</p>\n",

Just about as angry at our government as I've ever been. Over the past 5 or 6 years I've felt feelings that range the gamut from embarrassment to sadness to helplessness. Over the lies, dumb actions, venal activities, and just incredibly patronizing things that the executive branch (in particular, but not limited to) has done. \n</p><p>\nNow I'm just angry. \n</p><p>\nToday's news means, to me, that personal privacy of American citizens and foreign residents has been systematically and cynically violated, even while the president says, with a straight face, <em>that he protects our privacy rights. </em>Such crap. Complete, obvious lying to the public in such a cynical way. \n</p><p>\nI read an awful lot of history, and I'm jaded enough to know that the behavior of the United States has never been perfect (and sometimes downright bad), but I've also read enough to know that this is a pretty special place, founded on a set of ideals that have been largely beneficial to the world. I believe in the Declaration, and the Constitution, and democracy, even at the large scale of representative democracy that we have here &amp; now. \n</p><p>\nAnd so it's made me sad &amp; embarrassed to lose, as a nation, whatever stature we had in the world as a force for good. \n</p><p>\nI've been unhappy, but marginally willing to live with the restraints on personal freedoms given the world context today. While the Patriot Act is an abhorrent, knee-jerk reaction that mostly undermines the very liberties it's trying to protect, it's not so different in kind than Lincoln's suspension of <em>habeas corpus </em>or Adams' Alien and Sedition Acts. All regrettable, but fairly predictable reactions to threats (both perceived and real) to American security. \n</p><p>\nToday I feel like there's a line that's been crossed that puts us back into the days of J Edgar Hoover and Joseph McCarthy. Wiretaps, phone logs, surveillance on citizens and residents who've done nothing wrong, on the chance that maybe you could discover wrongdoing. \n</p><p>\nThat's not an idea that America was founded on, or one that has ever served us well. It puts Americans on the opposite side from the Government, and that can't sustain. Not here.\n</p><p>\nOf the people, by the people, for the people. \n</p><p>\nI'm not sure you can get there from here.\n</p>\n",

It's a really interesting book -- although probably only really worth finding if you're <em>both </em>interested in baseball and interested in Japan -- otherwise maybe it's a little on the esoteric side of things. I'm pretty sure that things have changed dramatically in the last 15-20 years, so would really be interested in a followup.

Here's a relatively long passage from part of the book that I particularly liked (it's not really a spoiler, but you might want to skip it if you're planning to read the book):\n</p><blockquote>\nAny handy road atlas describes the long tradition of noun names, adjectival names, that yoke abstraction to dirt, where we can get our grimy hands on it. Confluence, KY, Friendship, LA, Superior, CO, Commerce, OK, Plush, OR. Hope, AR, naturally. Oftentimes these names can also be found on the sides of packages of laundry detergent of abrasive cleaners, so generous and thorough is the sweep of their connotation. Freedom, needless to add. Can't forget Freedom.\n<br>\n<br>Truth or Consequences, NM. Hard to knock such brave and laudable candor. Such ballsy defiance to the notion of salesmanship. Pity the poor board of tourism for Truth or Consequences, NM! Death Valley, too, won points for its plainspoken delivery. Seeming to say: It's not like we didn't warn you.\n<br>\n<br>There were towns whose names were like thieves, attempting to pick the pocket of history, but instead became punch lines to jokes about the perils of juxtaposition. Milan, MN, Lebanon, OK, Dublin, IA, Brooklyn, OH. As if history came equipped with tiny snap-on hooks, was lightweight and portable and could be thrown up on available surfaces to accent the scheme of any room.\n<br>\n<br>There was also a long tradition in naming places for great men, or at least men who believed in their greatness. He'd always had a soft spot for Amerigo Vespucci, who got lost while looking for the Indies and hit nomenclature's Big Kahuna instead. Unless there was a gent named Europo he'd never heard about.\n<br>\n<br>He couldn't argue with America. It was one of those balloon names. It kept stretching as it filled up, getting bigger and bigger and thinner and thinner. What kind of gas it was, stretching the thing to its limits, who could say. Whatever we dreamed. And of course one day it would pop. But for now, it served its purpose. For now, it was holding together.\n</blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nThis is a post that I've been meaning to write for a few weeks now, but just haven't had the time. Here's the thing: since July, I've been on the Board of Trustees of the <a href=\"http://sunnyvale.ca.gov/Departments/Library/\">Sunnyvale Public Library</a> -- a 5 member board appointed by the City Council of Sunnyvale to overlapping 4 year terms -- with the responsibility for advising the City Council on library-related issues acting as advocates for Sunnyvale citizens. There are other boards which are probably more active &amp; politically exciting -- but I care more about reading and literacy than I do about maybe anything else. So the Library Board was a good fit for me.\n</p><p>\nIt's been a very interesting thing to do. Not always exciting -- we've got monthly board meetings which are open to the public -- they're generally pretty formulaic and not super-exciting. We get reports from the Library Director, Deborah Barrow (who I like quite a lot), and talk about library policies from time to time. One of the interesting things we're talking about is the Library of the Future -- no doubt a topic which most every public library in the world is wresting with, and has for some time. In Sunnyvale we've got just one branch, built in 1960 or so, to serve 130,000 residents (as of 2000).\n</p><p>\nBut anyway, here's the main thing that I wanted to say: it occurred to me during one of our sessions that the machinery of our civic life -- the people and processes that run our towns &amp; cities &amp; states &amp; countries -- are mostly invisible until things go wrong or you want them to work differently. Sort of like technology, actually. You use the end product every day, and generally things work. You only pull back the covers to see how the internals go if you want to change things or affect them. \n</p><p>\nSeems like maybe that's the way things always work in our society, for better or worse: small groups of people do the heavy lifting to create the infrastructure that we all use every day.\n</p><p>\nHere's a picture of what happened during a break in one of our meetings: the mayor and the parks department planted a tree (a gingko tree) for arbor day outside the library. Maybe 15 small kids and their parents were there, plus some of the city council members and library board members. Plus a couple of guys from Parks &amp; Rec, who clearly know a *ton* about their work and were incredibly gracious and open in talking about the tree to the kids. I was really happy to be there.\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/04-01-06_1051-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/04-01-06_1051-1-tm.jpg\" height=\"324\" width=\"430\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"04-01-06_1051\" title=\"04-01-06_1051\"></a>\n</p>\n",

My friends <a href=\"http://metacool.typepad.com\">Diego</a> and <a href=\"https://gsbapps.stanford.edu/facultybios/bio.asp?ID=159\">Bob</a> are teaching a very cool class there called Creating Infectious Action (CIA) and their first class project is about <a href=\"http://spreadfirefox.com\">spreading Firefox</a>.\n</p><p>\nThe class is just completely amazing, and I can't wait to see the projects that the teams come back with. They asked great questions -- some tough ones -- and are already starting to think about creative ways to get to audiences that we haven't effectively reached before.\n</p><p>\nAnd I'll say this, too: every time I have an interaction with the d.school I'm reminded of all the things that I really loved about my time and Stanford, and more. The spirit of inquiry and curiosity that they're creating there is completely infectious, and, like the <a href=\"http://stvp.stanford.edu/teaching/mayfield.html\">Mayfield program</a>, I'm a little envious that these programs weren't around back in the old days when I was there. Can't say enough about the great job that Diego, Bob, George and everyone there is doing. Feeling very lucky to be a part of it in our small way.\n</p>\n",

As they say, it's one of those moves that seems completely obvious now and just 48 hours ago seemed sort of impossible. I got an Intel Mac about a week ago and jumped through some hoops to get the <a href=\"http://onmac.net\">community-created solution</a> installed (which, by the way, is a brilliant example of how the hyperconnected Internet is changing things in a very positive way) -- and have now switched over to Apple's, for driver support &amp; wonky-reducing reasons. \n</p><p>\nIt's working great. Everything works well, very fast, very compelling.\n</p><p>\nHere's the important bit out of the article I pointed to:\n</p><blockquote>\nThe old equation — decades old — is that most computers ran Windows (or, if you go back far enough, DOS) and some other ones, the ones from Apple, ran Mac OS. As of today, the new equation is that all computers can run Windows, but some, the special ones from Apple, also run Mac OS X. (Including other PC operating systems like the various Linux distributions doesn’t really change the equation.)\n</blockquote><blockquote>\nThe distinction between these two equations may strike you as subtle, but the difference is potentially momentous. The point is that it recasts Macs from being “different” to being “special”. Instead of occupying a separate universe from that of PC hardware, it’s now a superset of PC hardware. Instead of choosing between a Windows PC or a Mac — which decision, as I wrote recently, for most people is more accurately stated as “choosing between a familiar Windows PC or an unfamiliar Mac” — you now get to choose between a computer that can only run Windows or a computer that can run both Windows and Mac OS X.\n</blockquote>\n",

They apparently had offers from Showtime to continue the show with the full cast, but Mitch Hurwitz, creator and producer, decided not to take the offers. While I'll miss the show -- I think it's the funniest on television -- I think this was the right decision. They ran a whole bunch of story arcs to ground in the last few episodes on Fox, and it clearly wouldn't have been the same show. \n</p><p>\nIn other news: I'm excited about Andre Braugher in <a href=\"http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/thief/main.html\">Thief</a>, starting tonight on FX. FX has done a great job lately -- \"The Shield,\" \"Rescue Me\", and \"Over There\" are all tremendous television shows. I'm very hopeful for Thief. Also means the return to television of Andre Braugher, star of the very best network drama ever, \"Homicide\".\n</p><p>\nAnd: after everyone who I rooted for in my blog lost (Cuba), I'll not tell you who I'm rooting for in the final four. I'll just say it's one of the schools named after a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason#Trivia\">founding father</a>.\n</p><p>\nAlso: crappy, crappy year so far for Stanford sports.

				"content_text": "<p>\nI'm rooting for Cuba tonight in the finals of the World Baseball Classic. My great experiences lately with Japan notwithstanding, I think the story of the Cuban team is just amazing. Because of the long, crappy relationship the US has with Cuba, these Cuban players have had no visibility on the worldwide stage at all -- so nobody really knew how to think about the Cuban team playing against powerhouses from other countries (like the Dominican Republic, with Pujols, Colon, Tejada, Big Poppy) since most people have never seen them play. Anyway, these players clearly don't get the worldwide recognition that they deserve, so I'm super-happy about their success to date in the WBC.\n</p><p>\n<strong>Other bit #1: TO in Big D.\n<br></strong>Terrell Owens will be fantastic in Dallas this year, I think. Next year, he'll lose his mind and take the whole Cowboys team with him. Good trade? I don't know. But it'll make awesome television. And holy cow, that guy is in incredible physical shape. If his mind were in the same shape, he'd be the richest guy on the planet. Or curing cancer.  Either way.\n</p><p>\n<strong>Other bit #2: Rooting for Bradley\n<br></strong>I was watching the Pitt-Bradley game yesterday with conflicted emotions. On the one hand, I have Pitt in my bracket going to the Elite Eight (note to self: stop betting on the Big East). On the other hand, you've got to root for the Braves. And underdogs in general.  So my new rule, I think, is not to root for my brackets, but let the chips fall where they may -- but pull for the underdogs, mostly. Exceptions to the rule: UK (even at a #8 seed, they're not exactly an underdog), USC (always), and Duke, UConn &amp; UNC, all perennial powerhouses. Arizona I'm on the fence about.  \n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nI'm reading a lot of blogs these days, and a lot of my good friends are pretty well known bloggers with real readership. I've been thinking some lately about why I do this blog, and what I want out of it. Here's why: at Mozilla we have something called <a href=\"http://planet.mozilla.org\">planet.mozilla.org</a> -- it's really a rollup of the blogs of anyone who's associated with the Mozilla project. I've been wondering if I should syndicate this blog to that -- I think a fair amount about things relevant to Mozilla folks (like my privacy post a few weeks ago) -- and it would really widen my exposure &amp; readership.  I write a lot of stuff that's not directly relevant, but think that breadth is good for people -- I do feel like one of the problems with the \"RSS Web,\" and the Web more generally, is that people get personalized content much more often, and serendipity is not as cherished. \n</p><p>\nAnyways.\n</p><p>\nI think I've decided, though, that I don't want to syndicate, because I don't really care about developing a broader readership. I think that I mostly write as a catharsis for myself; as a way to get thoughts out of my head and into some sort of order. Sometimes it's works, sometimes not so much. But even the act of choosing what to blog about helps me understand what I think about things. I find that I blog more (and write more) when I'm traveling -- I think there's an innate need to communicate with people I care about, in any way that I can. And while blogging is a bit of a one way street (the occasional comment notwithstanding), it at least helps with that need.\n</p><p>\nI think I like this just being the things that I want to pull out of my brain in whatever order I want to pull them out. My friends &amp; family I think will generally live with that. I don't think that I want/need to be more intentional than that. We'll see.\n</p><p>\nAnyway, it's dark in Tokyo now -- have been waking up at 4 each morning. Good trip this time, but not the same as last time. Last time was more of an adventure, this time more of a business trip. On the positive side, it's more comfortable here this time for me, more recognizable. \n</p><p>\nBut also, cold &amp; wet. Couldn't convince Schrep (or myself, really) to go to the Fish Market this time around, so no pics of big dead tuna this time. :-)\n</p><p>\nWorking this morning, then heading to Narita to come home.

We'll call it the \"anti-sorkin\". (As an aside, Sorkin &amp; Schlamme's \"Studio 60\" is set for the fall, and I'm <em>incredibly </em>excited about it. With Sports Night and the West Wing as their previous 2 efforts, hard to imagine how even Matthew Perry could screw this one up. I'm pretty sure that Sorkin will turn Perry into a giant star. Giant-er than now.)\n</p><p>\nAnyway, so Sleeper Cell isn't 24. It's a well written, well directed and well acted drama -- a little bit melodramatic at times, but excellent, nonetheless. \n</p><p>\nI'm really of 2 minds on the iTunes video store. On the one hand, it's just incredibly incredibly easy to grab a show online and watch it on my laptop -- and it's really just perfect for business travel. And on the face of it, the economics are approximately the same as buying the DVDs. (For a 24 episode series like, say, 24, you'd pay $48, which is more or less what it would cost on DVD. Economics for shorter shows like The Shield &amp; Sleeper Cell are a little better -- you can see a season for $20 or $30.) But with DVDs, I generally buy them, watch them, then sell them on Amazon for about $20 less, all in. So take the economics out -- let's stipulate that they're approximately the same -- or really somewhere between buying &amp; renting the media. (Although they're available much earlier, and often before a current season is over.)\n</p><p>\n3 things, though, bother me about video downloads like this, compared to DVDs:\n</p><p>\n- Quality. Pretty rotten, really. Boxy. Not unwatchable, but as everyone starts getting used to HDTV, I think it's going to get tougher &amp; tougher to love these. But that may be sort of like downloadable audio -- for a while it was hard to listen to, then it got good enough. So this is a temporary problem.\n</p><p>\n- DRM. Painful. I think that our idea of ownership of content is going through a pretty radical transformation now. On the plane, I wanted to be able to share the videos that I bought last night with Mike, but of course they're locked to my iTunes account. So I can do some wacky maneuvers to get him access for a temporary period of time, or else just throw up my hands and let him buy them himself. That doesn't really line up with my idea of content ownership, or even content rental. Doesn't seem like I should feel like I'm doing something illegal just to let a friend watch a video that I purchased.\n</p><p>\n- Permanence. Where do I put all this stuff? Do I care? Now that I own the whole first  season of Galactica and have watched it, do I really want to keep the 4 gigabytes on my hard disk? Can my 80 GB laptop drive really afford it? \n</p>\n",

It's an extremely readable account of the Cold War, written by one of the foremost historians of the period. I find myself forgetting what it felt like to grow up in the 70s and 80s sometimes -- but have memories of very worried feelings about nuclear war, even when I was an early teenager. Reading the book really helped me understand the concreteness of what was going on -- helped me to defuzz some of the boundaries of the war -- makes it really clear that it was a war.\n</p><p>\nWhat I particularly like about the book is that it talks not only about the events and the context, but the ideologies that were underlying the conflict.\n</p><p>\nI'm struck by a few things:\n</p><p>\n- At root, the difference between communism (small \"c\" communism) and capitalism and socialism isn't so much about end goals -- by and large, the end goals are centered around improving the quality of human life. The difference is, I think, in the nature of how to effect that improvement.\n</p><p>\n- There's another fundamental difference that the book points out: liberty is not the same as equality. And that while communism &amp; socialism were never unclear about this point, the United States really struggled during the Fifties with which was more important.\n</p><p>\n- The Soviet Union really gained legitimacy with victory in World War 2 -- for lots of reasons, but really, I think that the price that they paid for this legitimacy was the blood of their people, shed by the Nazis. And, of course, the nuclear capability that came just a few years later.\n</p><p>\n- Stalin was a bad guy. Truly.\n</p><p>\n- Korea could have gone much, much worse. As it was, a lot of things happened in Korea that really screwed up the world for the next 50 years, setting up the idea of \"dominoes\" falling and wars by proxy fought in regions that were increasingly irrelevant to the principals (US &amp; USSR).\n</p><p>\n- Grand social experiments will often have unacceptably high costs. Mao's Great Leap Forward. Stalin's forced transformation to an industrial proletariat. Millions upon millions died because they believed in theories that couldn't work in practice. Sometimes, of course, these experiments work: the US Revolution comes to mind, with them trying a whole new level of democracy. I think, maybe, that the difference is that in the first the experiment and responsibility for success all comes from the top, the government. In the second, the burden is placed on everyone, but they've got the tools -- the vote -- to do something meaningful. I think a lot about popular power these days during my time at Mozilla. The aggregate power of millions of people who are motived to do something, to support something, to be something -- probably no other force is stronger.\n</p><p>\n- Once Stalin died, Mao really took the mantle of the soul of Marxism, even as Kruschev and the Soviets built their Communist empire.\n</p><p>\n- Deng Xiaopeng is someone that I'd like to know more about. He was the first Chinese leader to exhort Chinese citizens to \"get rich.\" Purged multiple times by Mao, he put China onto a capitalist road <em>without </em>giving up absolute government control -- without introducing democracy. This would appear to me to be unique -- certainly it's difficult to tell the difference in Russia over the last 10 years between the effects of democracy and the effects of capitalism. If Putin hangs onto power for a while longer, maybe we'll figure that out.\n</p><p>\n- Because of the threat of nuclear war between (among?) superpowers, during the last 50 years of the 20th century, <em>stability </em>became the single most important factor in all geopolitics. Mutually Assured Destruction is an example of that. Eisenhower explicitly had no contingency plan other than total war -- because having plans for \"lighter war\" might make it easier to go to war and have inevitable escalation to nuclear war.\n</p><p>\n- Words matter. Symbols matter. And Gaddis points out that in this case, Actors matter. Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul, both former actors, along with Margaret Thatcher, <em>acted </em>like the Soviet Union was not legitimate -- that it did not have an equal ethical footing to the West. \"The Evil Empire.\" \"Tear down that wall.\" More than that, though, it seems that these 3 leaders did not accept that preserving the <em>status quo </em>was the most important thing, that <em>détente </em>represented an acceptable state of affairs.\n</p><p>\n- Rejecting the doctrine of mutually assured destruction probably hastened the end of the Cold War by years. While SDI was decades away from being achievable, the idea that one side could withstand a nuclear war in an asymmetric was a revelation. It made the idea of war much more real, and much scarier.\n</p><p>\n- The Soviet Union would have crumbled sooner or later, but actions during the 80s clearly made it happen more quickly.\n</p><p>\nAnyway, I could go on and on (already have, I suppose) -- very good read, and at only about 250 pages, an easy one to digest.\n</p>\n",

At this point, I'd say we're a chapter or two or three into the book you might call the Story of Firefox. Others with more vision than myself wrote the intro (the Netscape years, the AOL years, the rise of open source &amp; Linux), and then the critical pieces of the Mozilla Suite and Firefox development.\n</p><p>\nThen, of course, the Firefox release and crazy 2005 sprint to 50,000,000 users and more than 10% of the traffic on the web.\n</p><p>\nThere's a tendency to think about the \"Firefox Success Story\" at this point -- but I'd say that there's a lot left to be written.

I don't say this to be alarmist -- i've not believed that there's been much legitimate privacy in the world for a while now -- but I think that the trend is picking up the pace. \n</p><p>\nEveryone's attention, of course, is on our \"J. Edgar Hoover/Watergate burglers\"-style government invasions of privacy. Which are heinous. I have a bit of a hard time telling whether they're different qualitatively than other periods in our history with executive-branch abuses (Adams pushing Alien &amp; Sedition Acts, Lincoln suspecting <em>habeas corpus</em>). It <em>feels </em>to me like the worst abuses, but I don't have a wholly historic perspective, of course. \n</p><p>\nSo that's real, and bad.\n</p><p>\nBut I think the bigger problem is illustrated by Tivo &amp; Google &amp; Apple. (3 companies who make some of my very favorite products in the world.) Lots of people wrote about Tivo tracking what people watched &amp; how they watch (and <a href=\"http://www.preoccupations.org/2004/02/wardrobe_malfun_1.html\">rewatch</a>) television -- wondered what they were doing with the info (selling it, duh). Apple made the latest misstep with the little <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/11/itunes_update_spies_.html\">mini-music store</a>. And everyone knows about how <a href=\"http://battellemedia.com/archives/002283.php\">Google knows everything you've ever searched for ever</a>.  And now, when you do Google searches, the search results <em>even list the number of times you've visited a given site. </em>Creepy.\n</p><p>\nThe reason that all these folks are collecting information, of course, is marketing. The more they know about you &amp; your habits, the better they can get at showing you things you might want to watch, or click on, or listen to, or buy. Depending on your point of view, this is either amazingly great or an ever-present evil. \n</p><p>\nFor me, I like marketing. It's great. i just bought a <a href=\"http://www.gillette.com/men/index_fusion.htm\">new razor</a>. (5 blades! Man, how do they think of this stuff? Science fiction on my stubble every day. Like I'm living in the future. Wish I knew what was in the labs next.)\n</p><p>\nSo I'm conflicted. I feel okay about Amazon &amp; Tivo &amp; others knowing the stuff I like to buy because occasionally they suggest to me other stuff that is somehow missing from my life (but is destined to become integral!). And I like that.\n</p><p>\nAll the same, I'm starting to worry. \n</p><p>\nI search the web probably 50-100 times a day. I use iTunes pretty much the whole time I'm awake and not in meetings. I use an online calendar that's on a shared server. I blog about my shamefully high susceptibility to commercials with monkeys in them. (How'd they get the whoopie cushion?? Crazy monkeys.)\n</p><p>\nNow that I'm living a life that's becoming virtually wholly trackable online it's all a little creepy. \n</p><p>\nNot sure what conclusions to draw here, as I'm not going to go all Luddite and turn off my browser cookies.

Take a look here: <a href=\"http://pages.google.com\">http://pages.google.com</a> -- it's basically a browser-based way to create web pages &amp; web sites. \n</p><p>\nIt's a fine idea, of course, but I'm pretty sure it was called Geocities the first time around. \n</p><p>\nI do think, though, that the web has changed since Geocities came out -- there are more specific types of pages &amp; sites. Blogs. Photo sites. Movie sites. HotOrNot type things. Enough useful patterns like this have emerged that I'm unclear that generic HTML editors like Google Pages is worth it at all. Specifically the question I'm wondering about is whether the additional interface complexity that is a natural cost for including the HTML generality is worth it.\n</p><p>\nI think that the iWeb team at Apple figured this out. \n</p><p>\nUsing iWeb, you can't do some of the more generic type changes you can with Google's new stuff. But you can share pictures like crazy. And you can run a journal like crazy. (I don't say \"blog\" here because it doesn't (yet) do things like comments &amp; such.) \n</p><p>\nWe'll see. Maybe they'll get it integrated with Google Base and Google Video and they'll together turn into some sort of amazing chocolate, peanut butter &amp; ice cream milkshake. But I'm skeptical. Especially because I like so many of the other things that Google does. The disparity is just glaring.\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nWith credit for the title to Ben Taylor, I've been meaning to write this post for a while now -- it's been brewing back there in my brain since about July, if you can believe it. It's about what an incredibly good year 2005 was for me (and my family, I trust), and a few reflections that I've got as I turn 35 (last week).\n</p><p>\nNow: I'm in a slightly wacky emotional state just now. I sent Kathy &amp; Sam to San Antonio this morning as I got on a plane to Tokyo -- so that's a mixture of emotions that include a little melancholy, anticipation, curiosity, excitement and just a touch of loneliness and uncertainty. (Will it be just like <em>Lost in Translation??)</em> Add to that mix that I just read through an <a href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/hindsights.html\">old standby speech of Guy Kawasaki</a> that is both incredibly sappy and pretty close to right on the mark. (You should take 5 minutes and <a href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/hindsights.html\">read it</a>! Even if it means not reading all the junk that I'm putting up today.)\n</p><p>\nHere's the punch line: 2005 was the best year I've ever had. Nikhyl has a little 3 piece lens that he looks at his life through: Family &amp; Friends, Health, and Work. It leaves out the critical College Sports category, but let's set that one aside for the moment.\n</p><p>\nOn every category life is just great. Family &amp; friends should be obvious -- I was very lucky (and supported by Kathy) to spend the first 6 months of the year not working, taking time off. I connected with a whole ton of people that I hadn't been spending nearly enough time with. Sam came in July and is such a joy that I can't really find the words to appropriately describe how I feel. Kathy &amp; I are as close as we've ever been, I think, in spite of the massive sleep deprivation <em>(because of it?? :-). </em>I learned a lot about how strong &amp; graceful &amp; capable Kathy is in 2005. Stuff that I knew, pretty much, but so clear so many times during the year.\n</p><p>\nGot to see a lot of our folks (Sam's grandparents!) and our grandparents and aunts &amp; uncles and brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces during the year, in various pregnancy and eventually Sam-related events. Our folks were all incredible in supporting us and loving Sam -- we're lucky to have such support. Spent a lot of time with Beth's family, of course -- I can't believe how big Andrew &amp; Katie &amp; Emily are -- and how good they are to Sam &amp; how much they love him. Andrew's soccer games were great fun to go to -- I'm excited for the Spring season. Beth and Scott were awesomely supportive as well, during everything. Got to see Dave's family at Christmas -- he and Sue are doing great with Evan &amp; Grace -- both awesome kids and also terrific with Sam. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins -- it's just been a year full of very good visits.\n</p><p>\nOn the health side, I figured out how to get my body under control a little bit -- lost 40 pounds between December and April -- and now weigh a little less than I did in high school. Am absolutely fitter than I've ever been and I'm starting to understand more about my body and how what I do affects it. We'll see how this plane trip to Tokyo treats my back, but it's better than it has been in a long time. Again, of course, Kathy was critical -- first with the whole sugar-momma thing where she worked and I pretty much spent my time working on the yard, going to the gym, and playing Warcraft. She really helped me focus in on getting to where I wanted to get to, even during a time of her life when odd things were happening to her body during the first half of the year (we call them \"Sam\").\n</p><p>\nAnd work is totally great. I feel like by joining Mozilla I jumped right into the center of the Internet. My job is exciting, challenging, thought-provoking, frustrating, unpredictable, and, basically fun. I do miss Reactivity -- working with those folks was a special privilege -- I miss seeing them every day. (Well, seeing them like every 10th day or so, which is about how often I was in the office. Man, that was a lot of travel.) I'm advising a few startups, too, and generally doing the sorts of technology startup work and networking that I do. While I just felt tired when I left Reactivity, now I've got lots and lots of ideas (some good, some bad) and am excited to think about them.\n</p><p>\nI think to those three categories, I'll add a fourth: public life. I was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Sunnyvale Library in June, for a 4 year (!) term, by the City Council. It's a small entry into public and community life, but an important one for me, with an impact on something I care a lot about.\n</p><p>\nBut more than that laundry list, here's the thing -- in <a href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/hindsights.html\">Guy's aforementioned speech</a>, he says \"Pursue joy, not happiness\" -- and I'll tell you that I have more moments of joy these days than ever. The only other time in my life I can really compare it to is about 15 years ago -- I was an undergrad at Stanford and in the springtime I'd often get finished with classes (or skip them -- sorry Mom) and then wander over to Sunken Diamond with Bryan or Al to watch a baseball game and have a Lemon Slushee. Or even just an inning or two. I remember thinking about how great that was -- what a carefree, easy time it was -- and how I was lucky to notice and understand what a special time it was while I was still experiencing it. I feel that way now. Lots of moments of joy. Some obvious, some subtle. Some happy, carefree joy, some deep &amp; profound.\n</p><p>\nAnyway, I warned you that I was in an emotive state. :-)\n</p><p>\nI hope we all have a 2006 that is full of joyful moments.\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nMy Mac crapped out last week -- backlight died, which made it a little tricky to use. I was without it for about 6 days while Apple repaired it, but that's sort of beside the point -- during the time it was away I used a PC in the office. And I have to say that it really helped me understand that I really like OS X. I like using it, I like looking at it.\n</p><p>\nNow, it's not perfect (window layering model is not good; UI when you're using multiple large monitors is not good), but it's a good, powerful, mostly human-centered experience. That's awesome.\n</p><p>\nI'm a slightly unusual case in that I use both my OS X machine and my Windows desktop at home every single day -- I like going back and forth. I think there are many things that Windows does better. I think that a lot of the innovative stuff comes out first on Windows. I like Quicken on Windows a <em>lot </em>better. I think Windows menuing works better for large &amp; multiple monitors. (Mac UI nerds (I am one, of course) will start yelling at me about Fitt's Law, but should stop, because it's bogus and doesn't hold for screens the size that we have today (or for mouse targets that are over on the other screen of your multiple monitor setup).) Having said that, I think most of the disruptive innovations are happening not on Windows or the Mac, but on the Web.\n</p><p>\nAnother thing that I'm trying to sort out: Apple really understands how people want to use computers &amp; technology, but in funny ways, they don't really get the Web. (Everyone can start yelling at me about this, too.) .mac is sort of close to the mark. Photocasting is kind of there. But photocasting, while it nominally uses RSS, won't really work in the browser. As compelling as iLife and .mac are (and they are <strong>super </strong>compelling), they're not really in the spirit of the web.\n</p><p>\nSo here's the thing: I'm not religious about it, but lately I just like using my Mac more. I'm very glad that I have a PC, also, and plan to have the dual setup for good, more or less.\n</p>\n",

Well written, fast-paced, thought-provoking. But not for the faint-hearted. It's a very hard-edged story (think of the movie \"Unforgiven\") about a series of crimes in West Texas (think of the movie \"Lone Star\"). But not a book for people who want things that are neat, or have clear moral lessons, or are even just a little on the positive side. \n</p><p>\nWhile on the surface this is a crime novel about a drug deal gone bad on the border between Texas &amp; Mexico, that's really just a device -- what McCarthy does in this book is to take a few of his characters' lives and strip everything away -- home, family, work -- all their context, really -- and uses that technique to really look into what makes up a person's life. What defines each of us? Is it what we're willing to give up? Is it the things that we did yesterday?\n</p><p>\nAnyway, I've been thinking a lot about this book over the past few days -- I could write a lot more but don't want to ruin it for anyone. Would love to talk about it sometime with someone else who's read it.\n</p>\n",

This book I found super-interesting, at least the first 100 pages or so -- it's about innovation -- what it's for, when it's appropriate, and how to try to get it if you want it.\n</p><p>\nLike most of Moore's stuff, I net this book out with 2 important ideas that I've applied to things over the past few weeks. The first is core v context: what differentiates your company/product is core; everything else is context. While you may have some very important context (getting maintenance releases out, billing in a timely way, whatever), you'll never win because of great context (although you could lose because of bad context). Core is what matters most. So always look for ways and be structured about taking resources away from context (assuming you're not creating bad context) and moving them to core activities.\n</p><p>\nThe second idea is that innovation is never the right thing to do for innovation's sake (I worked in Apple's research labs, so understand this idea very well). He posits that innovation has 4 potential outcomes: differentiation (enabling pricing power), neutralization (getting to parity with your competitors' features), productivity (reducing production cost), and waste (often this is the main outcome).\n</p><p>\nAnyway, it's a book worth reading for anyone who's thinking much about how to make sure your company (at any stage) innovates in appropriate &amp; productive ways. \n</p><p>\n(Just came out on 12/29, but I've had an advance copy for a few months.)\n</p>\n",

While at times the vitriol is tough to read through, Schlesinger makes extremely compelling arguments against the war-related policies of our current administration. The most interesting idea in the book for me is that while some of our best presidents have gone beyond the Constitution in certain circumstances (Lincoln's suspension of <em>habeas corpus</em> comes to mind, Jefferson's purchase of the Louisiana Territory, etc.), the difference between what they did and what Bush is doing now is that they never claimed that what they were doing was within the laws of the Constitution -- they knew that they were breaking fundamental laws, acknowledged it, but did it anyway because of the circumstances of the specific situations. What Bush is doing, Schlesinger argues, is saying that what he's doing is anticipated and condoned in the Constitution -- a far more dangerous tactic, in that it weakens the Constitution over time.\n</p><p>\nAnyone who's really interested in historical antecedent for the things that are happening in Washington (and Iraq and Guantanamo Bay and on and on...) should read this.\n</p>\n",

It seems clear to me that both Lord &amp; Potter are significantly richer &amp; deeper experiences and with less obvious agendas than the allegory of Lewis. Narnia seems flat to me today -- the characters are very thin, the stories very simple, and the allegory transparent. I find that I'm not as entranced/overwhelmed with Narnia as I am with MiddleEarth; I'm not as in love with the characters and the story as I am with Hogwarts. \n</p><p>\nI do think that it's an important series of books -- in particular, I think the first book is important; I could do without the cosmology of the last two -- in terms of setting up a template for talking about kids in fantasy worlds and for creating from whole cloth so many fantasy ideas. I do think they're worth reading and hope that Sam will read them when he gets a little older (he's still working through <em>Good Night, Moon</em> at the moment) and I hope they'll open up as many new ideas &amp; thoughts as they did for me.\n</p><p>\nOne other note: the traditional ordering of the series was the order that Lewis published the books in -- when Harper Collins purchased the rights in the 1970s, they reordered the books to be chronological, because Lewis at one point said that they might make more sense that way. This puts <em>The Magician's Nephew</em> first in the series, and <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em> second. My own feeling is that this pretty well ruins the series. As I mentioned above, the magic moment for me and millions of other kids, I presume, was when the 4 kids stumbled through the wardrobe -- that motivates everything else in the whole series. In the new order, you're learning the \"why\" of things before you really care very much about the \"who\" or the \"what.\" Just my 2 cents.\n</p>\n",

Ignorance makes the headlines, wins the medals, doles out the punishment, jingles the coin, yet in its clandestine cubbyholes (and occasionally on the public stage) enlightenment \n<br>continues to quietly sparkle, its radiance outshining the entire disco ball of history. Its day may or may not come, but no matter. The world is as it is! Life as it is! Enlightenment is its own reward.\"\n</p><p>\nFantastic, wonderful language -- it's why I really like Robbins, even in a crummy collection. :-)\n</p>\n",

I'm sure Kathy will have great pictures to post soon, but I just wanted to say that while we were worried about how Sam would react to the large number of people, the loud noises, etc., he was amazing! He didn't like things at first -- had his bottom lip thrust out for a few minutes in the first half -- but after that, he settled in and really paid attention to the game. Was startled every time something happened and people cheered/booed, which got worse when he fell asleep in my arms for the 2nd half, but eventually he just was cool about the whole thing.\n</p><p>\nWe'll have his 2nd game this coming Saturday -- hopefully he'll do as well this time. Was afraid for a while that this season might be a TV-only season, but I think he's a gamer. :-) What a great kid.\n</p>\n",

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions\" (Ben Mezrich)</a>\n<br> maybe a couple of years ago when it first came out -- it's the story of the MIT Blackjack Club, and how they developed team card counting techniques. Really fun read -- only took a day to read and was interesting to read about what they were up to, how they ran into some (bad) trouble, etc.\n</p><p>\nThis book, Busting Vegas, is a sort of unintended sequel -- it's about just a few people from MIT that, instead of developing card counting techniques, decided instead to do some observational tricks to tilt the odds into their favor a <em>lot</em>. The book follows these half dozen folks from MIT to Las Vegas to Atlantic City to Aruba to Monte Carlo, and talks about how they did what they did.\n</p><p>\nI was reading the epilogue, written by one of the principals, and he talked a bit about how folks would wonder why he was willing to share his techniques in detail -- and he said he was lately watching the open source movement in software -- particularly Firefox's gains against Microsoft --- and incredibly encouraged. So he figured he'd do the same sort of thing to bring down the casinos. Amazing, I thought.\n</p><p>\nFun book to read -- ultimately, it reads a lot like his first book about MIT nerds breaking the casinos, but is fun nonetheless.\n</p>\n",

What a great title, though!\n</p><p>\nThe story is about the relationship between Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick -- the two men who really build Carnegie Steel into a behemoth of a company -- and really the beginning of the age of titans here in the United States. Pretty fascinating history, about a time (late 1800s), region (Pittsburgh &amp; surrounds), and industry (steel) that I don't know a ton about. The book centers around the Homestead works -- a very productive steel mill near Pittsburgh -- and a labor conflict that left several dead, set labor relations in America back probably 40 years, and has echoes even to the current day. As you might surmise from the title, the once cordial relationship between the 2 men didn't end up all that amicably. \n</p><p>\nAnyway, a good book, but probably of somewhat limited interest -- only really for folks who are wondering about that era (leading up to the creation of US Steel by JP Morgan and others) or why everything in sight in higher education is named after Carnegie.\n</p>\n",

This seems laughable to me, as W did everything but say, \"hey, she's one of us. she'll vote our way\" and do a big wink to the cameras. Seems to me that the right wing interest groups wanted her to say what she'd do, and that's a pretty horrible way to choose a justice, for any number of reasons.\n</p><p>\nThe way that she pulled out this morning, by saying that she didn't want to divulge the work she did with the President, since it's covered by executive privilege, is pretext, clearly -- she just wasn't going to have the votes. But it creates another problem...most people think W's short list is something like Janice Brown, Edith Clement, Edith Jones and Al Gonzales. (Not to mention some conservative white guys like Michael Luttig.) Torture memo notwithstanding, Gonzales is the most moderate of the bunch, but seems to me that he's impossible, and will have the exact same set of issues that Miers is stating for her withdrawal (executive privilege) because of his time in the White House.\n</p><p>\nSo it feels to me like we'll get someone from the far right -- Janice or one of the Ediths. And Harry Reid's words today as Minority Leader in the Senate smell to me like fighting words.\n</p><p>\nMaybe the administration figures a nasty Supreme Court fight will be better news cycles than Rove's or Libby's indictments.\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Well, I'm at work now, but waiting for a meeting to start, so I figured I'd post a little bit. (It's not like I have a million other things I should be doing, but this seems to be what I *am* doing, so good enough.)</p>\n\n<p>I want to post things about how I'm having a tough time getting through any books lately (and as a result am in the middle of 8 of them -- no joke), about how balance is really the toughest thing, about my big new external monitor and my move to an external mouse, about managing my weight with lots of different demands, more reflections on switching to the Mac, lots of other things.</p>\n\n<p>What I think I'll write for now, though, is about Datapower -- Reactivity's main competitor. They got bought on Monday by IBM, reportedly for north of $100M. (My data suggests, though, not much north. Sort of like how Palo Alto is more or less north of Mountain View.) I've got many thoughts about this, and lots of folks are asking me about it, since I have a particular point of view -- I'll not post too many of my detailed thoughts here because they're still a little sensitive (not emotionally -- from a business context.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://billburnham.blogs.com/burnhamsbeat/2005/10/datapower_a_vcs.html\">Here's a post from one of their VCs</a> about the deal. Some of it is definitely true. All of it, probably not.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I will say: What Bill writes about the collision between networking &amp; application infrastructure companies is absolutely true. I don't think that anyone yet knows how it's all going to shake out, but there's truth here. Also, I think, the Datapower acquisition signals the endgame for the first round of XML processing companies -- Sarvega was purchased by Intel a few months back, now Datapower, and I have to think that there will be a game of musical chairs coming up now. </p>\n\n<p>It's a strange feeling to see the main competitor of the company I founded get bought -- has made me reflect over the past couple of days about Reactivity -- it seems both like yesterday and like a million years ago. I think I'm glad to be a little distanced from it now -- it lets me root for the team there (still very good friends of mine, all), but not get enmeshed emotionally in it. </p>\n\n<p>Interesting times, for sure.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and Sam is a joy. Kathy's been incredible the last few months (as always), and it's really been tough on her, sleepwise and otherwise. She's happy, of course. Sam is just great, though. Happy little kid. Smiles a lot. Grabs his toys now. Still does little jokes where he'll make funny noises to get you to notice him. A joy.</p>\n",

The America I loved still exists at the front desks of our public libraries.\"</p>\n</blockquote><p>Fantastic!</p>\n\n<p>This latest book from Kurt Vonnegut is a very short collection of essays -- not more than about 100 pages, and I read it in an afternoon, which is saying something given my current reading rate. Vonnegut has always, to me, been a provacative and smart author -- in the tradition of great American authors like Mark Twain and John Steinbeck, but with slightly more aliens and scatalogical humor. One of my favorite skeptics -- although he'd call himself a humanist.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years he's gotten a little ticked at how things have gone in this country, and the current adminstration, coupled with Vonnegut's advanced age, has resulted in some really scathing writing from him. While I don't agree with all of it, I believe in a lot of it.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that asking questions, putting a fine point on the choices that we're making as a society and a country, and really talking about what's happening -- these characteristics are some of what makes authors truly great -- and they're what Kurt Vonnegut has done his whole career. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe that's why he's been banned so much in our libraries, too, come to think of it.</p>\n",

(Here's a great one of <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/khowe/PhotoAlbum120.html\">our nephew Andrew's first soccer game</a>. As you can see by the numbering in the URL, this is the 120th album that she's posted in the past couple of years. 1 a week or so. She's also used .mac as a place to get her e-mail forwarded to -- with some grief (the interaction between .mac and mail.app went through some rough spots, in our experience).</p>\n\n<p>The yearly renewal is coming up -- it's something like $99/year for 100MB of disk space. </p>\n\n<p>And we're thinking about it. Not sure what to do. </p>\n\n<p>What's happening on the net is interesting. With GMail supporting POP and giving me 2.6 GB of storage space, not to mention being a *great* &amp; innovative mail client and awesome example of how good a web-based AJAX application can be, there's no reason in my mind to use any other web-based mail application.</p>\n\n<p>With flickr, slide, picasa, typepad &amp; others, there are getting to be way more powerful ways to store &amp; share pictures online, and cheaper to boot. Readers on this blog will notice that mostly for Sam we're using typepad photo albums instead of .mac based photo albums (really enabled by someone who wrote an iPhoto plug-in that makes it easier to automatically export from iPhoto).</p>\n\n<p>So it's the same old story: the vertical integration of Apple/MacOS/iLife/.mac is amazingly good -- easy to use, generally works great -- but is more expensive (by a bunch, really -- Typepad is $149/yr to store 1GB and support blogs; .mac is $99/year for 100MB and no blogs, but some other features like the above-mentioned e-mail that are marginal value to us). On the other hand, there's a ton of innovative stuff on the web (<a href=\"http://www.slide.com\">www.slide.com</a>) that's evolving very quickly into more cool stuff, it's cheaper (often free or minimal cost), but it just doesn't integrate as well, especially with OS X, but generally with everything.</p>\n\n<p>So. I don't know. I'm betting we end up paying for .mac again this year in addition to our Typepad account. But I don't think it'll be very compelling by this time a year from now.</p>\n",

Here's what I mean: the effects of Katrina were indisputably horrible. The human toll was (and is, and will be for a long time) horrendous. I think that with or without Sam I would have felt that way. But with Sam everything becomes more vivid, more real. Makes me think about how hard daily life would be in a situation like that. Pregnancy &amp; childbirth &amp; the first 8 weeks of Sam's life was tough enough here in the Bay Area, and we've got everything, really. Support from people who love us, a stable home environment, jobs, etc. Not to mention little things like hospitals, doctors, diapers, water or an environment mostly free of disease &amp; bacteria. </p>\n\n<p>And that's such a simple, obvious example. It seems funny/amazing to me that such a little guy, without a lot of the abilities that we typically call \"human\" -- being able to talk and communicate, really, or sympathize, or some of the more sophisticated emotions -- that he'd lend such a profound humanity to everything I see.</p>\n",

It had everything -- two small island teams playing against each other (Hawaii &amp; Curacao), the defending champs (Curacao), a comeback from 3 runs down in the last at bat (Hawaii tied it with a spectacular suicide squeeze play and some other timely hitting), and a home run to win it for Hawaii in the bottom of the 7th (which is extra innings in LL). I found myself getting pretty wrapped up in the game -- was super-excited to see the Hawaii kids not lose hope down three runs in their last at-bat and eventually come through to win. Curacao played great, too -- in fact, pretty much every kid on the field was completely unbelievably great at the game.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, during the game I really got excited -- was reminded by a phrase in a James Taylor song: \"There is a feeling like the clenching of the fist...\" -- and started thinking about the times when I was a kid and really felt the thrill of a game. There were lots of times when I felt that thrill, or the pain of a loss, or even the left-out feeling of not participating. It's interesting that you don't get many of those moments as an adult.</p>\n\n<p>And with Sam, I can't help but wonder about his times to come -- good, bad, indifferent.

				"content_text": "<p>Big day! Sam's about 6 1/2 weeks old now, and the greatest thing happened. I started sticking out my tongue at him, which consistently provoked one of two responses: he either gave me a big smile or else he stuck his tongue out back at me! Sounds like maybe not a big deal, but pretty great. Near as I can tell, it's the first time that he really had a response to an overt stimulus from us (other than the occassional smile, sometimes stopping crying or sometimes starting crying :-)), and really one of the first times he got involved in playing a game. Fun!</p>\n",

Sort of a boring read, honestly. But learned a few tidbits. Like this: in the 19th century, (bad) American wine was marketed as a temperance solution -- less alcoholic &amp; insidious than the hard stuff. And I never really thought about it, but the 18th Amendment, establishing Prohibition, meant that America's alcohol-related industries didn't really start until the 1930s, and didn't gain a ton of momentum until the 50s. Fortified wine was a big deal; Thunderbird was a huge seller, and the world didn't really think much of American wine until the 70s, at the earliest. I guess  the other thing that it made me think about is that the global wine industry is a living, changing thing -- looks different now than it did even 5 years ago, prior to 9/11. </p>\n\n<p>Not a fantastic book, but not bad if you're interested in this type of thing.<br></p>\n",

Pretty great, I have to say. I could have done that all weekend. </p>\n\n<p>A smile from Sam is literally all it takes to make me feel just amazing -- over the moon, really. And it got me to start thinking about expectations and what it takes to make me (or us) happy. Just a month ago, we were over the moon just to have a baby boy in the world with 10 fingers and 10 toes. Then we raised the bar a little bit, and we were just thrilled when he'd eat 20 cc's of formula. But the days are gone when we'd be really excited about a loud belch, or a big poop, or a 2 hour nap. (Actually, I'm lying. We still get pretty excited about all 3 of those things. Not kidding. The other parents reading this will know what I'm talking about.)</p>\n\n<p>Anyhoo, over the coming days and weeks and months and years, we'll have a bunch of new firsts together -- first cooing, first words, first steps, first appointment to the Supreme Court, first Nobel Prize, that type of thing -- and they'll all be great. It seems to me to be good to keep raising the bar and encourage development and achievement.</p>\n\n<p>But I want to put a stake down now, set the bar for now &amp; all times. I hope to always be touched when Sam smiles. Melt the way that I did this weekend. Lots of milestones left to go, I think -- I'm not sure that many will be much better than seeing our boy be happy.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I think most of you know that I watch a lot of television. Seriously, a lot. I love it. And increasingly over the years I've been drawn to these hour-long dramas with really complex story arcs. Started with \"Homicide: Life on the Streets\" (still among the best television shows of all time), went through things like \"The West Wing\" and now has ended up with all the *fantastic* HBO shows -- in particular, \"The Wire\" and \"Deadwood\" (and hopefully \"Rome,\" which starts this fall). Some great stuff lately on FX as well -- \"The Shield\" and \"Rescue Me\".</p>\n\n<p>[As an aside, it's clear that I don't like *all* television. Some new ABC show called \"My Kind of Town\" is on right now, and it is absolutely, 100% putrid. Makes me feel dumber for even watching it.]</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, as much as I like this latest crop of dramas, I have to say that I think the sitcom, long given up for dead, especially against the crush of reality television, is rising from the dead. Not the mainline junk that's mostly on the networks -- Will &amp; Grace, Joey, stuff like that. But more innovative, 1 camera shows like \"Arrested Development\" and \"Scrubs\". (\"1 camera\" is my new term of art for sitcoms that I learned from Bravo's \"Situation: Comedy,\" a sort of \"Project Greenlight\" for sitcoms instead of movies -- means that the show is filmed with a single camera, but multiple takes, in lots of different locales that generally aren't sets, as compared to a multi-camera setup that's more traditional and shot with a few sets, multiple mostly fixed cameras.)</p>\n\n<p>\"Arrested Development\" is about the funniest show I've ever seen. I'm watching the replays of the second season now on Fox, and they're just amazing -- the writing is so incredibly sharp. 3 or 4 times the jokes crammed in, and a very very fast pacing. Funny stuff. Kathy &amp; I are also working through season two of \"Scrubs\" -- like \"Arrested,\" it manages to be wickedly funny, but sweet &amp; poignant at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>And there's more to come, with \"My Name is Earl\" (NBC) and \"Everybody Hates Chris\" (WB) coming this fall. </p>\n\n<p>I'm shocked, but there it is.</p>\n\n<p>As always, important, hard hitting analysis from your friend John.</p>\n",

We&rsquo;ve been\nadmitted, seen the doc, and, hey!, Kathy was right. Labor. Contractions\nare every 5 minutes or so now. Kathy&rsquo;s hooked up to an IV for\nhydration, and the techs are taking some of her blood now. Dr. Hoff\nsays things look very good; baby&rsquo;s heart rate is doing very well, and\neverything is fine. We&rsquo;re watching <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Princess\nBride<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on DVD now &ndash; one of Kathy&rsquo;s favorite movies, and she&rsquo;s\nin pretty good spirits. &ldquo;Anybody want a peanut?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Almost 8p now &ndash; time seems to be moving pretty quickly. Kathy got her\nepidural about 45 minutes ago, and life has been a lot better since\nthen. Around 5p the contractions got to be super-painful &ndash; she was\nhaving a really tough time. It&rsquo;s still early going yet &ndash; she was about\n2 cm dilated (on the way to 10 cm, for folks who haven&rsquo;t gone through\nthis) &ndash; but contractions are happening every 3 minutes very regularly,\nand everything is good. Beth came by a bit ago and was here for all the\npain/epidural excitement, plus she brought me a sandwich. Really nice\nto have her here. Now she&rsquo;s out getting dinner, Kathy&rsquo;s asleep (yay!)\nand I&rsquo;m watching the American League beat the bejeesus out of the\nNational League in the All Star Game, plus listening to some Amos Lee\non my iPod. I&rsquo;m glad Kathy&rsquo;s getting a little sleep &ndash; it was hard to\nwatch her go through the painful bits a while ago. It&rsquo;s really nice\nthinking about all of our family going to bed tonight thinking about\nthe new little guy who&rsquo;ll be here tomorrow. Clarity is coming in fits\n&amp; starts for me. Every once in a while I get glimpses of us as a\nfamily, or me as a dad, or Kathy as a mom. It&rsquo;s hard to put words to\nit, really. But it&rsquo;s a special feeling, I know. It&rsquo;s a weird thing to\nexplain &ndash; there&rsquo;s a certain feeling of communion knowing that this\nfeeling of becoming a parent is something that so many other people\nhave felt &ndash; a type of humility and shared experience, I think. I\nsuspect I&rsquo;ll have a lot of these moments over the coming hours, days,\nmonths &amp; years. Anyway, just now I&rsquo;m happy that Kathy&rsquo;s getting a\nbit of respite.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Getting close to midnight &ndash; after sleeping for about an hour, Kathy\n&amp; I watched an episode of Scrubs, then one of the Muppet Show &ndash;\nthe awesome episode when Steve Martin guest starred. What a great show.\nFun to think that we&rsquo;ll get to experience all of these things that we\nlove like the Muppets with our boy. Kathy&rsquo;s going back to sleep now,\nbut I&rsquo;m not too tired, so I&rsquo;m going to watch some stuff on my laptop\nthen maybe get some sleep myself. We&rsquo;re thinking that it&rsquo;ll probably be\n4a or so when the real action starts &ndash; maybe looking at a 5a birth?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>4a now, July 13th. Birthday, looks like. Happily, Kathy&rsquo;s pretty much\nasleep now, and has gotten a few hours since midnight as well. I\nstepped out of the room for a bit, because as long as I was there, the\ntwo of us wanted to chat, which means not being asleep. :-) Anyway, I&rsquo;m\nin a small waiting room down the hall for a bit while she sleeps. The\nhospital is really empty tonight &ndash; just nothing going on. We think\nthere&rsquo;s another woman in very early labor across the hall from us, and\na co-worker of Beth&rsquo;s who had a baby girl about 12 hours ago, but\nthat&rsquo;s it. In the rest of the hospital, everything is pretty much\nsilent, even the ER. I just stepped outside a little bit for some fresh\nair and it helped a lot &ndash; you forget that you&rsquo;ve been inside for a\nlong time breathing inside air. One of the things that I really love\nabout the Bay Area is what nighttime air feels and smells like &ndash; crisp\n&amp; cold, no matter what time of year. A little after midnight we had\na bit of a scary episode: the baby&rsquo;s heart rate declined to about 80 or\n90 beats per minute, after being pretty much at 150 all day. We think\nit got worse when they had Kathy turn onto her right side &ndash; during the\npregnancy, the little guy has pretty well burrowed into her right ribs.\nThey turned her back onto her left side and everything has been good\nsince. Speculation is that maybe the umbilical cord is in a funny\nposition &ndash; that may mean Dr. Hoff has to be a little creative during\ndelivery, but we&rsquo;ll see. I did have my first truly parental feeling, I\nthink &ndash; I felt just for a minute that there was maybe something really\nwrong with my boy and I couldn&rsquo;t do a single thing to help him. Stomach\nclenched &ndash; just a terrifying, helpless feeling. I suppose I&rsquo;ll feel\nlike that more often from now on. That seems okay to me. :-) Anyway,\nthe baby was never in serious distress; things seem to be fine now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>7:10a, things going fine. Kathy&rsquo;s at 7 cm, so could be awhile still.\nWe&rsquo;ve been here 21 hours now, so a good long time, but she&rsquo;s doing just\ngreat. She&rsquo;s starting to feel some discomfort in her ribs with each\ncontraction now, but not a lot else to report. It feels different here\nin the morning &ndash; new day, new things to happen. On the news they&rsquo;re\ntalking mostly about the space shuttle Discovery going back into space\nafter the time off because of the accident. 34 years ago, when Kathy\n&amp; I were born, we had only recently gotten to the moon &ndash; I wonder\nwhat space exploration, and other science, will be like 34 years from\nnow. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>12:30p now, and Kathy&rsquo;s resting &ndash; she&rsquo;s almost completely dilated,\nwhich means it&rsquo;s nearly time to push, which we figure will take an hour\nor so, depending on how things go. It&rsquo;s taken a little bit longer than\nwe expected, with some adventures with her epidural getting\ndisconnected, but things are doing well now, the baby&rsquo;s heartbeat is\nstrong, and he&rsquo;s nearly here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>12:40p. In the few minutes before all the action, it&rsquo;s pretty quiet in\nhere &ndash; nothing but the steady beat of our boy&rsquo;s heart. I like watching\nKathy sleep now, getting a bit of extra energy in.

Somehow, I&rsquo;m really proud of our boy, too. I don&rsquo;t know how\nthat can be, since we haven&rsquo;t really laid eyes on him yet, and he\nhasn&rsquo;t done much more than kicking Kathy in the ribs a bunch of times\nover a lot of months. It&rsquo;s weird &ndash; listening to his strong little\nheartbeat, I feel proud of him for just hanging in there.

				"content_text": "<p>\nWe're in the hospital now -- just after I got to work this morning\naround 8:45a, Kathy called thinking her water broke. So I canceled all\nmy meetings on my drive home (it's a quick commute now -- only about 10\nmins), and got home. Kathy was pretty much all packed up &amp; ready to\ngo -- I, on the other hand, had nothing at all together. I think it was\nsome sort of psychological denial behavior -- we had pretty much\nconvinced ourselves that Kathy was doing amazingly well, still going to\nthe gym and everything -- so we figured the baby would be late and we'd\nend up scheduling induction for next week sometime. So anyway, I threw\nsome clothes into a bag, then grabbed another bag and threw\napproximately a dozen pieces of electronics gear (and power supplies!)\nin, and we were ready to go. I mean, it's a little ridiculous, really.\nWe've got 2 iPods (my full size &amp; her shuffle), 2 digital cameras\n(an SLR &amp; a point and shoot), mini-speakers, my laptop, 2 cell\nphones. Tons of stuff. I guess the kid will want his/her own iPod soon.\n:-)</p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnyway, now it's 11a; we've been here about 45 minutes, and the nurses\naren't quite clear on whether her water's broken. We're pretty clear,\nbut that doesn't seem to count. :-)</p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\n11:20a now, and I think they're about to send us home, but are going to\ncall the doc first. This all seems very sketchy to me. Basically, they\ntest the pH to see if the water's broken, using that litmus paper that\nwe all used back in high school science. It came back as inconclusive.\nSeems like we should know somewhat more definitively what's going on,\nbut maybe not.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\n12:55p and we're still here, but haven't talked with the doctor yet.\nSeems like Kathy's feeling contractions maybe every 20 minutes now, and\nwe think her water's definintely broken, but, again, don't have\nconfirmation on it.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\nNow it's 3:30p, and the kid is definitely on the way. We've been\nadmitted, seen the doc, and, hey!, Kathy was right. Labor. Contractions\nare every 5 minutes or so now. Kathy's hooked up to an IV for\nhydration, and the techs are taking some of her blood now. Dr. Hoff\nsays things look very good; baby's heart rate is doing very well, and\neverything is fine. We're watching <em>The Princess\nBride</em> on DVD now -- one of Kathy's favorite movies, and she's\nin pretty good spirits. \"Anybody want a peanut?\"</p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAlmost 8p now -- time seems to be moving pretty quickly. Kathy got her\nepidural about 45 minutes ago, and life has been a lot better since\nthen. Around 5p the contractions got to be super-painful -- she was\nhaving a really tough time. It's still early going yet -- she was about\n2 cm dilated (on the way to 10 cm, for folks who haven't gone through\nthis) -- but contractions are happening every 3 minutes very regularly,\nand everything is good. Beth came by a bit ago and was here for all the\npain/epidural excitement, plus she brought me a sandwich. Really nice\nto have her here. Now she's out getting dinner, Kathy's asleep (yay!)\nand I'm watching the American League beat the bejeesus out of the\nNational League in the All Star Game, plus listening to some Amos Lee\non my iPod. I'm glad Kathy's getting a little sleep -- it was hard to\nwatch her go through the painful bits a while ago. It's really nice\nthinking about all of our family going to bed tonight thinking about\nthe new little guy who'll be here tomorrow. Clarity is coming in fits\n&amp; starts for me. Every once in a while I get glimpses of us as a\nfamily, or me as a dad, or Kathy as a mom. It's hard to put words to\nit, really. But it's a special feeling, I know. It's a weird thing to\nexplain -- there's a certain feeling of communion knowing that this\nfeeling of becoming a parent is something that so many other people\nhave felt -- a type of humility and shared experience, I think. I\nsuspect I'll have a lot of these moments over the coming hours, days,\nmonths &amp; years. Anyway, just now I'm happy that Kathy's getting a\nbit of respite.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\nGetting close to midnight -- after sleeping for about an hour, Kathy\n&amp; I watched an episode of Scrubs, then one of the Muppet Show --\nthe awesome episode when Steve Martin guest starred. What a great show.\nFun to think that we'll get to experience all of these things that we\nlove like the Muppets with our boy. Kathy's going back to sleep now,\nbut I'm not too tired, so I'm going to watch some stuff on my laptop\nthen maybe get some sleep myself. We're thinking that it'll probably be\n4a or so when the real action starts -- maybe looking at a 5a birth?</p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\n4a now, July 13th. Birthday, looks like. Happily, Kathy's pretty much\nasleep now, and has gotten a few hours since midnight as well. I\nstepped out of the room for a bit, because as long as I was there, the\ntwo of us wanted to chat, which means not being asleep. :-) Anyway, I'm\nin a small waiting room down the hall for a bit while she sleeps. The\nhospital is really empty tonight -- just nothing going on. We think\nthere's another woman in very early labor across the hall from us, and\na co-worker of Beth's who had a baby girl about 12 hours ago, but\nthat's it. In the rest of the hospital, everything is pretty much\nsilent, even the ER. I just stepped outside a little bit for some fresh\nair and it helped a lot -- you forget that you've been inside for a\nlong time breathing inside air. One of the things that I really love\nabout the Bay Area is what nighttime air feels and smells like -- crisp\n&amp; cold, no matter what time of year. A little after midnight we had\na bit of a scary episode: the baby's heart rate declined to about 80 or\n90 beats per minute, after being pretty much at 150 all day. We think\nit got worse when they had Kathy turn onto her right side -- during the\npregnancy, the little guy has pretty well burrowed into her right ribs.\nThey turned her back onto her left side and everything has been good\nsince. Speculation is that maybe the umbilical cord is in a funny\nposition -- that may mean Dr. Hoff has to be a little creative during\ndelivery, but we'll see. I did have my first truly parental feeling, I\nthink -- I felt just for a minute that there was maybe something really\nwrong with my boy and I couldn't do a single thing to help him. Stomach\nclenched -- just a terrifying, helpless feeling. I suppose I'll feel\nlike that more often from now on. That seems okay to me. :-) Anyway,\nthe baby was never in serious distress; things seem to be fine now. </p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\n7:10a, things going fine. Kathy's at 7 cm, so could be awhile still.\nWe've been here 21 hours now, so a good long time, but she's doing just\ngreat. She's starting to feel some discomfort in her ribs with each\ncontraction now, but not a lot else to report. It feels different here\nin the morning -- new day, new things to happen. On the news they're\ntalking mostly about the space shuttle Discovery going back into space\nafter the time off because of the accident. 34 years ago, when Kathy\n&amp; I were born, we had only recently gotten to the moon -- I wonder\nwhat space exploration, and other science, will be like 34 years from\nnow. </p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\n12:30p now, and Kathy's resting -- she's almost completely dilated,\nwhich means it's nearly time to push, which we figure will take an hour\nor so, depending on how things go. It's taken a little bit longer than\nwe expected, with some adventures with her epidural getting\ndisconnected, but things are doing well now, the baby's heartbeat is\nstrong, and he's nearly here.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\n12:40p. In the few minutes before all the action, it's pretty quiet in\nhere -- nothing but the steady beat of our boy's heart. I like watching\nKathy sleep now, getting a bit of extra energy in. I'm so proud of her\nthrough this whole pregnancy -- she's just been incredibly strong,\ngraceful, responsible -- through a lot of weird, uncomfortable\nsituations. People we've seen over the last few weeks couldn't believe\nthat she was so close to due -- she's just been incredibly positive and\nenergetic and happy. I'm really proud of her. </p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\n12:50p. Somehow, I'm really proud of our boy, too. I don't know how\nthat can be, since we haven't really laid eyes on him yet, and he\nhasn't done much more than kicking Kathy in the ribs a bunch of times\nover a lot of months. It's weird -- listening to his strong little\nheartbeat, I feel proud of him for just hanging in there. I think he\nknows the jig is up now, though -- he knows something's happening to\nthe warm, comfortable spot his mom has kept for him over the last 9\nmonths. Starting to move around a bunch, time to head out. </p>\n\n<p>\n\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n\nnow it's 10p on July 13, 2005 -- and Samuel Pearce Lilly is getting\ntowards 7 hours old now. he's sleeping soundly; kathy and <br>\n\ni are listening to music and watching him sleep. amazing. perfect,\nreally. here's a bit from a simon &amp; garfunkel song that just played\nthat seems appropriate: </p>\n\n<p>\n\n    ...<br>\n\n    my mind's distracted and diffuse<br>\n\n    my thoughts are many miles away<br>\n\n    they lie with you when you're asleep    <br>\n\n    and kiss you when you start your day.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n    ...    <br>\n\n    and so you see i have come to doubt<br>\n\n    all that i once held as true<br>\n\n    i stand alone without beliefs <br>\n\n    the only truth i know is you.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n    and as i watch the drops of rain<br>\n\n    leave their weary paths and die.<br>\n\n    i know that i am like the rain --<br>\n\n    there but for the grace of you go i.</p>\n\n<p>\n\nknow what that song's called? \"kathy's song\". always been one of my\nfavorites. anyway, after a lot of amazing effort by kathy, Sam was born\nat 3:20p this afernoon. 8 lbs 1 oz, shattering the over under -- we\nwere thinking more like 7 pounds. 19 inches tall. and super healthy. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nbeen a busy day for us -- we spent a little time with the little guy,\nthen i went with him to get a quick checkup and bath. since kathy's\nwater had been broken for more than 18 hours, they wanted to do a blood\ntest on him -- everything came back great. he's been mostly sleeping\nsuper peacefully for the last 4 hours or so -- it's fun to just watch\nhim. so many expressions he's already got that we've never seen.\nanyway, that's it for now. more late tonight, probably. </p>\n\n<p>\n--</p>\n\n<p>\n5:30a on Thursday morning now; Kathy's working on teaching Sam to eat a\nbit more.

We'll see.\n\nAnyway, I've got lots of specific thoughts that I should post on (like what a pain it was to get my contacts &amp; calendar moved from Outlook to the native applications), but that's a start. Not sure yet whether I'll be more productive or not; but the UI is a whole lot shinier (in a good way, I think).\n",

Demand for watching a college baseball game, especially one that's not in the College World Series and is between two relatively small private schools (Stanford &amp; Baylor), and during a workday to boot, is never going to be high enough to justify a real TV broadcast with professional broadcasters -- but it's definitely high enough to have the university's video students and radio broadcasters cover -- and broadcasting like this, reaching a bigger audience than they could otherwise -- should generate more donations for them, plus give them a way to put in more advertisements to generate even more revenue.</p>\n\n<p>But mostly, I just like being able to see Stanford baseball, even when it's happening such a long way away.</p>\n\n<p>And, incidentally, we're now in the 11th inning, with a Stanford sophomore (Reynolds) having pitched the whole game so far.

Truly.</p>\n\n<p><em>Cat's Cradle</em> is probably my favorite book by Vonnegut, who's always been one of my favorite authors. He's written for more than 50 years now, and has had a huge effect on American and World literature -- in my mind, in very many ways he's a modern day Mark Twain (also a tremendous writer &amp; thinker about his world, if not his get-rich-quick schemes).</p>\n\n<p>This particular work is a story about Felix Hoenikker, father of the bomb (in this fictional world), his family, his invention ice-9, a small Carribean island named San Lorenzo, and a holy man named Bokonon (and his outlawed religion, Bokononism). Here's a taste: \"The first sentence in <em>The Books of Bokonon </em>is this: 'All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies.' \" Of course, the first page of <em>Cat's Cradle</em> has this quote, also from <em>The Books of Bokonon:</em> \"Live by the <em>foma </em>[harmless untruths] that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy.\"</p>\n\n<p>One of my favorite passages from the book:</p>\n\n<p>Newt (Felix's son) says, \"For maybe a hundred thousand years or more, grownups have been waving tangles of string in their children's faces...No wonder kids grow up crazy. A cat's cradle is nothing but a bunch of X's between somebody's hands, and little kids look and look and look at all those X's. . . <em>No damn cat, and no damn cradle</em>.\"</p>\n\n<p>Anyway. This is maybe the third or fourth time that I've read this book, and I can't recommend it highly enough. It gives you a very clear sense of hopes &amp; fears during the Cold War, but at the same time seems very current and insightful towards today's geopolitical situation.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>A happy thing happened this week -- I got called to serve Jury Duty for California Superior Court when I actually am off work and have time to do it! I really value the privilege (and obligation) that we're able to serve on juries and effectively manage our own community. I cringe when I hear folks talking about how easy it is to get out of doing it -- of course it is -- but that isn't really the point.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I went to the courthouse on Tuesday morning at 8:30a to check in -- there were about 75 of us, and it was for just one case -- criminal Battery. (I didn't learn many of the details of the case, but it seems that the defendant allegedly assaulted a pregnant woman who called the police but eventually didn't want to press charges -- but in California only the DA can decide that, so the case went forward.)</p>\n\n<p>We went into the courtroom around 9:30, and listened to the judge do his instructions/standup routine for maybe an hour, then started <em>voir dire</em>, or selecting the jury. Here's how it worked: they called 12 of us from a random list -- those 12 (not me) sat in the jury box. Then they called another 6 to sit in alternates' chairs. The judge went through each prospective jury and asked them questions that boiled down to whether people really like &amp; trust the police (or the opposite) and how they felt about certain aspects of the case (for example, one man whose wife is expecting a baby received extra scrutiny because the alleged assault was on a pregnant woman) -- it all came down to trying to find a fair &amp; impartial jury. This went on for a couple of hours (we had a break for lunch) and the judge eventually got through the 18; then the defense &amp; prosecuting attorneys got to ask their own questions. After that, they each got to remove jurors for any reason at all -- they each got 10 of these removals they could make. They each made 3 (6 total), so the 6 alternates moved up into the jury box, then the judge called 6 new randoms to sit in the alternate chairs and did the same thing all over again. This time the lawyers didn't have any objections to the jury as constituted, so they kept the 12 plus one alternate and let the rest of us go home. I was home by about 3p. </p>\n\n<p>The funniest question &amp; answer was when the judge asked if one of the prospective jurors had any bias towards the lawyers or the defendant (he really meant racial or gender-based), and she replied that she thought the prosecutor was a lot smarter than the defense attorney. Everyone laughed. She didn't make it to the jury, obviously. :-)</p>\n\n<p>Part of me wanted to be chosen for the jury because I've got the time lately and I think it's an interesting &amp; important process. But more of me was happy to get a day's dose of it and still have the time to go to the gym. In between courtroom sessions I managed to read a good bit of a new biography of Andrew Jackson that mom sent me -- I'll post on that soon. Interesting book, interesting man. Funny/interesting how many of today's political issues are echoes of similar ones from the origins of our country.</p>\n",

One of the five best books I've read in the past few years, and probably one of the five best debut novels that I've ever read. (That's a fun list to think about. Maybe I'll post on that in a while.)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this book is told from the perspective of a very smart 10 year old in NYC who lost his dad on 9/11. Like in his first book, Foer is tremendously talented at putting you into another person's shoes, and is great at creating the voice of Oskar (the 10 year old). The book really explores Oskar's relationship with his mother &amp; grandparents, and is a sort of coming-of-age story for Oskar.</p>\n\n<p>Extremely emotional book; I really enjoyed it. About 3 days after I finished it we were able to hear JSF give a talk at Kepler's -- and I was extremely impressed in all respects. One of my favorite authors; an emerging talent for sure.</p>\n",

One of the things I find strange about cosmology books is that they're all a mix of science and history. They all start with theories by Greeks like Anaxagoras &amp; Aristarchus, move to Copernicus, Kepler &amp; Galileo, and eventually meander their way into the 20th century, when the real action starts. </p>\n\n<p>I was super-bored with the first 250 pages or so -- it was all history of science type stuff that I've read many times, forgotten a few, and is ultimately important but not that interesting to me lately. Once I got up to Einstein &amp; Hubble, though, things got much better. For the first time, I understand (I think) what cosmic radiation is, and why it's here. Interesting to me that it was only in 1992 that the really compelling last piece of evidence for the Big Bang was observed (the COBE project detected very small variations in levels of cosmic radiation that resulted in forming the seeds of galaxies about 300,000 years or so after the Big Bang).</p>\n\n<p>I suppose that the reason cosmology is always covered as such a mix of biography and history and science is because of the huge awareness that it's an evolving field, and it's very possible we're still wrong on some of the fundamentals -- so it's important to understand how &amp; why we've been wrong and evolved before. </p>\n\n<p>I am not sure I can recommend this book to many folks -- I really liked the last 100 pages or so -- once Wilson &amp; Penzias observed background radiation -- but up until that point it was a slog. I learned some good things, though, so maybe worth it.</p>\n",

He wrote a book a while back called <em>The Lexus and the Olive Tree</em>, which is where I started learning some global economic ideas like securitization of debt &amp; such. Anyway, he's a very smart guy, and I'd really recommend reading his bi-weekly New York Times column to every citizen. </p>\n\n<p>In this book, he steps away from global politics for a bit, back towards economics, and takes a look at the globalization that's happening in our world. His basic premise is this: Globalization 1.0 lasted from 1492 to around 1800 -- \"...it shrank the world from a size large to a size medium. Globalization 1.0 was about countries and muscles. That is, in Globalization 1.0 the key agent of change, the dynamic force driving the process of global integration was how much brawn...your country had and how creatively you could deploy it.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Globalization 2.0 lasted roughly from 1800 to 2000, interrupted by the Great Depression and World Wars I and II. This era shrank the world from a size medium to a size small...the key agent of change, the dynamic force driving global integration, was multinational companies.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Globalization 3.0 [which started around 2000] is shrinking the world from a size small to a size tiny and flattening the playing field at the same time...the thing that gives it its unique character is the newfound power for <em>individuals</em> to collaborate and compete globally.\"</p>\n\n<p>First he talks in the book about why this is happening -- he gives 10 basic \"flattening forces\":</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>11/9/89 [the fall of the Berlin Wall]</li>\n\n<li>8/9/95 [Netscape's IPO]</li>\n\n<li>Work Flow Software [to enable collaboration across time &amp; space]</li>\n\n<li>Open-Sourcing [to drive down the cost of software to virtually zero]</li>\n\n<li>Outsourcing [which lets companies focus on their core  competencies] </li>\n\n<li>Offshoring [to enable access to a huge and inexpensive labor pool]<br>\n</li>\n\n<li>Supply-Chaining [giving companies better control over their supplies]</li>\n\n<li>Insourcing [like outsourcing, but turned around a little bit]</li>\n\n<li>In-forming [Google is everywhere]</li>\n\n<li>The Steroids [\"Digital, mobile, personal and virtual\"]</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>and throughout he goes through examples, many of which are in my own backyard here in Silicon Valley. This is the first time I've read Friedman and felt like I was ahead of him (I always feel hopelessly behind when he talks about geopolitics) -- he was explaining things about Google and Walmart.com and Indian outsourcing firms that I've understood for a while.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a great example that I didn't know: through lots of data mining techniques, Walmart happens to know that when hurricanes approach, people drink more beer, and during the worst weather, people eat more pre-packaged food like PopTarts (I like the Brown Sugar ones the best, if you're interested). So they've defined what they call a \"hurricane mix\" of products that a typical hurricane-affected store should stock. When the Walmart staff meteorologists (!) identify a potential hurricane, Walmart's supply chain &amp; logistics software <em>automatically</em> shifts the mix of products to be delivered to the affected stores to the hurricane mix. Amazing.</p>\n\n<p>I had thought coming into reading the book that his main idea (the world is now flat, from a competition point of view) was going to be over-simplistic -- after reading it, I find that it's shifted my thinking and provides a useful frame for thinking about a lot of things.</p>\n\n<p>The second half of the book is more about globalization and geopolitics -- a great blend of things that yields some great insight from Friedman and makes the book worth reading.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what he ends with; it's a message to his daughter who just went off to college this year:</p><blockquote><p>\"The world is being flattened. I didn't start it and you can't stop it, except at a great cost to human development and your own future. But we can manage it, for better or for worse. If it is to be for better, not for worse, then you and your generation must not live in fear of either the terrorists or of tomorrow, of either al-Qaeda or of Infosys [an Indian outsourcing firm]. You can flouish in this flat world, but it does take the right imagination and the right motivation. While your lives have been powerfully shaped by 9/11, the world needs you to be forever the generation of 11/9 [the fall of the Berlin Wall] -- the generation of strategic optimists, teh generation with more dreams than memories, the generation that wakes up each morning and not only imagines taht things can be better but also acts on that imagination every day.\"</p></blockquote>\n",

Talks about SAIL &amp; SRI &amp; the Whole Earth Catalog &amp; the Homebrew Computer Club, plus an awful lot about the politics of the time and how they affected attitudes here -- really very West Coast attitudes and how those points of view were critical in developing a vision for a \"personal\" computer. </p>\n\n<p>Also, there's a shocking large number of words in the book devoted to LSD.

Not really real. </p>\n\n<p>This book is a very good piece of work that explains the roots of the conflict in Rwanda, gives some insight into what it was like to really be there, and it helped me get my head around the enormity of the tragedy (sort of). </p>\n\n<p>Pretty amazing book, I thought. I also watched \"Sometimes in April\" on HBO right around the same time, which helped. Haven't seen \"Hotel Rwanda\" yet. Sometimes seems to me that words just fail in a context like this. And while I'm glad that I now understand just a glimpse of this series of events, I can't help but wonder about all of the tragedies around the world now that don't have books &amp; movies about them.</p>\n",

Steven Levitt is an unconventional economist at the University of Chicago who likes applying economic techniques to unusual questions.

(He's got a bunch of data to support that. </p>\n\n<p>It's an easy &amp; fun read -- none of the stuff in it is super deep or life changing, but it'll change the way you think about which questions to ask.

Here's a quote that I particularly liked:\n\n<blockquote>Novels and movies, being relentlessly modern, propel you forwards or backwards through time, through days, years or even generations. But to do its noticing and judging, poetry balances itself on the pinprick of the moment. Slowing down, stopping yourself completely, to read and understand a poem is like trying to acquire an old-fashioned skill like dry-stone walling or trout tickling.</blockquote>\n\nNot that I really know what \"trout tickling\" is, but a nice thought, nonetheless. I've been thinking a fair amount about what novels are lately -- will post some of that in a post soon about Jonathan Safran Foer -- so this is interesting.\n",

As the book starts, Okonkwo thinks a lot about how much better he's become than his father was -- how much richer, how much stronger, and how much more respected. Given the title, you can probably imagine how it goes from there. \n\nI was struck reading this book that it really tells two stories: one that's really about Africans and the introduction of outsiders, colonizers, and new technologies, but another that's more universal about how hard it is to hang on to the past and fight against change.

I read <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. I read every book by Ray Bradbury. Iread every book by Raymond Chandler. I reread every book by Raymond Chandler. I read every book by Kurt Vonnegut, including <i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater.</i> I read every book by Richard Brautigan and Norman Mailer. I kept a complete set of the stories of Guy de Maupassant on the edge of my loft bed, and tried to read one a night until I finished it (I failed). I saw every movie by Stanley Kubrick, except for <i>Killer's Kiss.</i> ... I watched <i>Star Wars</i> twenty-one times in a single summer, largely alone. I sat alone at the Thalia, on West Ninety-Fifth Street, anw watched <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> three times in one day. ... [lots more elided here by John] ... In my late twenties I lulled myself to sleep to Chet Baker records for a while, and at the peak of my Chet Baker obsession I owned more than fifty Chet Baker CDs, though I was never satisfied because I knew someone who had more than a hundred Chet Baker CDs.\n</blockquote>\n\nand then the payoff:\n\n<blockquote>\nI rarely listen to Chet Baker anymore. I haven't read Vonnegut or Bradbury or Brautigan since I was a child, partly because I'm afraid of what I'll find, partly because they have become inscribed on the interior surface of the eyes through which I read others... I couldn't bear to listen to Talking Heads records [anymore], even the ones I'd previously revered, after <i>Naked</i>... All their music became poisonously embarrassing to me the moment I realized it wasn't as good as I'd claimed it was (and no band is as good as I'd claimed Talking Heads were in the years I adored them). ...\n\nIt was my splits from Talking Heads and Stanley Kubrick and Don DeLillo that left me as indignant, ashamed, and unmoored as breakups with a girlfriend or wife, wondering who'd failed whom.\n</blockquote>\n\nReflecting on it now, I sort of think just those bits were worth the price of the book and the time to read it. Talking about how a bunch of formerly deeply loved influences \"have become inscribed on the interiour surface of the eyes through which\" he looked at other works -- that seems exactly right to me. It seems that it's more universal a theme than just for authors and their writing, but is more about growing up in a media-saturated world like we do now. \n\nAnyway, while <i>The Disappointment Artist</i> ultimately wasn't everything I was hoping for, it gave me a bit of insight.

I found much of the content interesting, although a little bit arcane (predictably, I suppose), and the author a little more sympathetic &amp; apologetic for the Church than I would have liked. As an example, the book spends quite a lot of time going through two episodes &ndash; the sexual abuse scandal in the US, and teh Iraq war &ndash; and goes into excruciating detail on who did what, when, and why. It was a lot more detail than I expected, and it didn&rsquo;t completely change my views on the situation, but certainly gave me some other points of view to think about that are worthwhile.

I found much of the content interesting, although a little bit arcane (predictably, I suppose), and the author a little more sympathetic &amp; apologetic for the Church than I would have liked. As an example, the book spends quite a lot of time going through two episodes -- the sexual abuse scandal in the US, and teh Iraq war -- and goes into excruciating detail on who did what, when, and why. It was a lot more detail than I expected, and it didn't completely change my views on the situation, but certainly gave me some other points of view to think about that are worthwhile. I'm predicting that this book, and another of Allen's books, <i>Conclave</i>, will sell extremely well in the coming months or years as a new Pope takes the spot. A fine book, but I probably can only recommend it to you if you've got a lot of extra time. :-)\n",

But I suppose you have to say that he cared a lot about healing the country after the Civil War, and took actions that certainly weren't punitive, and probably went a long way towards making it one nation again.\n\nAnyway, I don't mean to sound like I didn't like the book -- it's pretty well-written, and I read it in a day and a half -- just tough, slightly mundane content to work with, in terms of presidential biographies. Next in the Boring Lives of Presidents Series: James K. Polk. \n\nJust kidding.\n",

Trapped here at home as I am right now, with painters painting our new windows, now seems like as good a time as any.]</p>\n<p>As everyone who reads this knows, I left Reactivity, the company I founded with BJR &amp; BJR, in December, after 7 years there, in just about every role and job you can imagine. Reactivity is doing well &ndash; really well, in fact &ndash; continuing to close new customers, getting good reviews in the press, and really serving customers well. And to be honest with you, while there were some parts of my job that I didn&rsquo;t like all that much (150,000 miles flown in a year is a lot), on most days I liked what I did. But I still decided to walk away.</p>\n<p>Lots of reasons &ndash; ones that I feel good about &ndash; but that&rsquo;s not what I wanted to talk about in this posting. What I wanted to talk about is how I feel having left. I guess I thought that it would be an extremely emotional thing to do, and I&rsquo;d be feeling it now, weeks later. But it&rsquo;s been remarkably emotion-free for me. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand: I care about &amp; miss some of the folks there that I built the business with and worked shoulder-to-shoulder with.  But it isn&rsquo;t an emotional thing. I don&rsquo;t have separation anxiety from Reactivity or anything like that &ndash; every once in a while in a meeting I&rsquo;ll feel a little funny not having business cards, or having to explain who I am &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not really a big deal.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m feeling in this emotion-light way &ndash; although I have a few theories. (Incidentally, I had lunch the other day with a friend who founded and walked away from his own company (Vividence) &ndash; he&rsquo;s had this same reaction.)</p>\n<p>One theory is that after 7 years at Reactivity, with a restart, multiple tricky financings and a lot of ups &amp; downs, there just wasn&rsquo;t much emotion left. But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it.</p>\n<p>Another theory that I have that I think is probably correct is that Reactivity has given me a confidence that I&rsquo;ll always (or often, at least) be able to create and find environments that I' m really happy in .  Which means that while I&rsquo;m proud of what we built there, and enjoyed many of the pieces, I have a feeling that I&rsquo;ll be able to find or create good places to be going forward. They won&rsquo;t be the same, of course &ndash; and I think there&rsquo;s probably no experience like starting your very first company &ndash; but I have a confidence that things will work out just fine.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure that this will make sense to anyone but me, but wanted to capture what I&rsquo;m feeling.</p>\n",

And to be honest with you, while there were some parts of my job that I didn't like all that much (150,000 miles flown in a year is a lot), on most days I liked what I did. But I still decided to walk away.\n\nLots of reasons -- ones that I feel good about -- but that's not what I wanted to talk about in this posting. What I wanted to talk about is how I feel having left. I guess I thought that it would be an extremely emotional thing to do, and I'd be feeling it now, weeks later. But it's been remarkably emotion-free for me. Don't misunderstand: I care about &amp; miss some of the folks there that I built the business with and worked shoulder-to-shoulder with.  But it isn't an emotional thing. I don't have separation anxiety from Reactivity or anything like that -- every once in a while in a meeting I'll feel a little funny not having business cards, or having to explain who I am -- but it's not really a big deal.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm feeling in this emotion-light way -- although I have a few theories. (Incidentally, I had lunch the other day with a friend who founded and walked away from his own company (Vividence) -- he's had this same reaction.)\n\nOne theory is that after 7 years at Reactivity, with a restart, multiple tricky financings and a lot of ups &amp; downs, there just wasn't much emotion left. But I don't think that's it.\n\nAnother theory that I have that I think is probably correct is that Reactivity has given me a confidence that I'll always (or often, at least) be able to create and find environments that I' m really happy in .  Which means that while I'm proud of what we built there, and enjoyed many of the pieces, I have a feeling that I'll be able to find or create good places to be going forward. They won't be the same, of course -- and I think there's probably no experience like starting your very first company -- but I have a confidence that things will work out just fine.\n\nAnyway, I'm not 100% sure that this will make sense to anyone but me, but wanted to capture what I'm feeling.\n",

In past decades many of the countries in that area were not fully self-governing.   Other nations exercised considerable authority in the area and the security of the region   was largely built around their power. But since the First World War there has been a   steady evolution toward self-government and independence. This development the United   States has welcomed and has encouraged. Our country supports without reservation the full   sovereignty and independence of each and every nation of the Middle East.\n \n...\n \n      <p>The occasion has come for us to manifest again our national unity in support of freedom   and to show our deep respect for the rights and independance of every nation - however   great, however small. We seek, not violence, but peace. To this purpose we must now devote   our energies, our determination, ourselves.\n  </p>   <p></p> </blockquote> <p>--</p> <p>Everything old is new again.\n\n</p>\n",

And it goes deeper than just the &ldquo;religious&rdquo; type of religion, but also extends to what I&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;secular religions: belief in country, family, neighborhood, work, etc. So most of Coupland&rsquo;s books follow characters that have always been approximately my age as they try to connect what happened yesterday with what&rsquo;s happening today with what they hope might happen tomorrow.

				"content_text": "The 2nd installment in Donaldson's <i>The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever</i>, the only real fantasy trilogy that I've ever read that approaches the scope of Tolkein. Actually, that's not quite right -- the Terry Brook's Shanara books are similar in scope as well, and while I really enjoyed them, they always seemed to me to be directly derivative of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. \n\n<i>Covenant</i> I always thought was basically the same -- I read it around the same time as a kid.

				"content_html": "<p>Since I&rsquo;m leaving Reactivity, I thought it&rsquo;d be appropriate to post the note that started it off back more than 7 years ago, for posterity&rsquo;s sake. I&rsquo;ll have more to say about leaving probably next week.</p>\n<p>&ndash;</p>\n<p>Last Friday, Adam, Tom Kosnik (a biz school prof who teaches at Harvard and Stanford) and I were hanging out and talking&ndash;mostly I was trying to figure out what I do next. To make a long story short, it looks for sure like ATG is going to get demolished this month, which means that Apple isn&rsquo;t a place that I want to be any more. So we were talking about startups that Tom knows that I could go to, then it occurred to me that I could start doing freelance work&ndash;there seems to be an awful lot of work to go around in the valley right now. Then Tom asked both of us what our ideal jobs would be. And, bottom line is that I really want to spend my days with people I both care about and respect, and spend my time helping to <em>create</em> something. And that my skill set seems to be helping people to connect with each other and to do cool things together.</p>\n<p>One of the things that I&rsquo;m starting to realize is that nobody is going to <em>give</em> me my perfect job&ndash;and so it seems like the best way to do something fun is to just create the perfect job and figure out how to make it work.</p>\n<p>Tom noted that the biggest problem in the valley right now is that nobody can find good, talented engineering or creative people&ndash;Sun has something like 1000 job openings, Intel has the same, Cisco and Oracle as well. Microsoft is going to be hiring something like 3500 people this year. But for us&ndash;everyone on the distribution list&ndash;finding talented people is about the easiest thing we can do&ndash;I know <em>tons</em> who are looking for interesting places to be. And almost everyone that I know says that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;planning to start up in a year or so&hellip;&rdquo; but just looking for the right opportunity.</p>\n<p>And so Tom suggested that we just take a look at what the best biz schools and engineering schools in the country are (Stanford Engineering, Stanford GSB, MIT Engineering, MIT Biz, HBS, CMU Engineering, Cornell Engineering, Cornell Biz, Princeton Engineering) and try to figure out how to build a business built around collecting the right groups of people together.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to the actual idea:</p>\n<p>A metastartup (this is a temporary name only&ndash;trying to think of a better one) is a company who&rsquo;s mission is to foster a community of talented engineers and business people, with the goal of spinning off startup companies from that community, as well as to build a loosely coupled network of those companies.</p>\n<p>I believe that there will be very many types of flavors to a metastartup&ndash;a couple have already emerged:</p>\n<p>IdeaLab (<a href=\"http://www.idealab.com/)\">http://www.idealab.com/)</a>: This is a company in Pasadena founded by a guy named Bill Gross. The basic idea is that he&rsquo;s got lots and lots of ideas for startups, as well as a whole bag of money, and is recruiting anybody he can get his hands on to come work on one of his ideas to start up. I think that they&rsquo;ve got 18 companies in their portfolio after a couple of years. He basically sets people up with offices, HR functions, ideas, a team, and VC. Check out <a href=\"http://www.herring.com/mag/issue44/gross.html,\">www.herring.com/mag/issue&hellip;</a> which is an article from The Red Herring.</p>\n<p>Interval Research (<a href=\"http://www.interval.com/)\">http://www.interval.com/)</a>: Interval is a research tank of about 100 people, created by Paul Allen, and funded from 1992 to 2002 by $100M, I think. It&rsquo;s mostly composed of relatively famous designers who have made their marks in the computing industry, although there are quite a few artsy types there as well. Their business model is to be really free and loose and let their researchers work on whatever they want, and to spin off ideas whenever it seems appropriate. They&rsquo;ve got 3 spinoffs to date: Carnelian (software for traditional publishers), Purple Moon (software for girls) and Electric Planet (also software for girls). Not a lot of public information about them; they&rsquo;re extremely inwardly focused.</p>\n<p>What I&rsquo;m thinking of, though, is less patriarchal, less funded, and more egalitarian than IdeaLab, and much more urgent, much less funded, and much less academic than Interval.</p>\n<p>The model would be to have a core set of people in the metastartup, who focus on continuity, mentoring, cross-fertilization of ideas, and recruiting, and hiring mostly young people, mostly right out of school or after their first or second high tech job, for a time period between one year and two years, with the expectation that sometime in the second year of being at the metastartup, they would find a team to join that spins off, with the metastartup retaining some equity portion of the spinoff, and the spinoff retaining some reciprocal equity stake in the metastartup (and, transitively, in every other spinoff in the community).</p>\n<p>Which all sounds sort of neato&ndash;but the big question is obviously how to pay everyone&rsquo;s salaries. The revenue model that I&rsquo;ve been working on so far has a few different possibilities. The obvious ideal is to have a few of the startups go public, which would presumably fund metastartup development for some reasonable length of time, and that&rsquo;s my expectation for the long term. But how to get it started? Seems like there are two possibilities (along with some versions that are mixtures of the two): venture capital funding (Tom Kosnik seems to think that this would be relatively easy to get) or self-funding, through consulting work.</p>\n<p>VC has lots of different possibilities&ndash;the major advantages would be (1) a close connection with a VC&rsquo;s network and (2) cash. I think that there are a couple of disadvantages: (1) you lose quite a bit of your equity when VC&rsquo;s fund and (2) in funded ventures, people seem to have a problem with &ldquo;keeping their eye on the ball.&rdquo; That is, when your salary doesn&rsquo;t depend on execution, it&rsquo;s easy to work on something that&rsquo;s not quite critical to your business. One of the guises of a VC-connection that Adam and I just talked about is that there would be the possibility of a VC deciding that this is a really good way to develop engineering and creative talent as a resource for startups, and absorb the whole metastartup as some sort of development arm.</p>\n<p>The consulting route is clearly harder, at least at first, because of the obvious problem of splitting time between what you want to be doing, developing the startups, and what pays your bills. I think that we can mitigate this problem a bit by being sort of careful about the consulting jobs we pick (there seems to be way more consulting work in the valley than anyone can do)&ndash;and trying to position the company as a sort of IDEO, that is, an advanced research company. One possible example is that a friend of mine is the CEO of an internet startup (about 100 people, I guess), and they&rsquo;re really looking to build some sort of research lab to do advanced prototyping&ndash;the metastartup could contract that work out, doing market research and prototype and technology design. I have the feeling that we could find a lot of work like that.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of other ideas in this, but it&rsquo;s really late, and I need to go to bed&ndash;one more piece, though, is one borrowed from Interval, and that&rsquo;s the idea of people in the company having a certain number of &ldquo;project points&rdquo; that they have to spend. So, for instance, you might assign everyone 20 points wehn they start&ndash;and their main project, the one that nothing takes priority over, is worth 12 points, a consulting project is worth 5 points, and smaller roles on other people&rsquo;s project might be worth 2 or 3 points each. That&rsquo;s a neat idea for at least 3 reasons&mdash;it helps cross-fertilization of talent and ideas, it gives us a way to measure % of time spent bringing in dollars, and it would give us a way to involve people at some level less than a full employee&ndash;you could imagine hiring &ldquo;associates&rdquo; or something that don&rsquo;t quit their day jobs, but get involved at the level of 5 points or so&ndash;this would be a risk reduction way to get people involved and engaged. Better than that, though, is that it would provide a way to get students still in school involved&ndash;to have associate groups at Stanford and in Boston, for instance, of students spending some % of their time working on metastartup stuff&ndash;which could be anywhere from contributing ideas from their scholarly work to doing actual consulting work.

I'll have more to say about leaving probably next week.\n\n--\n\nLast Friday, Adam, Tom Kosnik (a biz school prof who teaches at Harvard and Stanford) and I were hanging out and talking--mostly I was trying to figure out what I do next. To make a long story short, it looks for sure like ATG is going to get demolished this month, which means that Apple isn't a place that I want to be any more. So we were talking about startups that Tom knows that I could go to, then it occurred to me that I could start doing freelance work--there seems to be an awful lot of work to go around in the valley right now. Then Tom asked both of us what our ideal jobs would be. And, bottom line is that I really want to spend my days with people I both care about and respect, and spend my time helping to *create* something. And that my skill set seems to be helping people to connect with each other and to do cool things together.\n\nOne of the things that I'm starting to realize is that nobody is going to *give* me my perfect job--and so it seems like the best way to do something fun is to just create the perfect job and figure out how to make it work.\n\nTom noted that the biggest problem in the valley right now is that nobody can find good, talented engineering or creative people--Sun has something like 1000 job openings, Intel has the same, Cisco and Oracle as well. Microsoft is going to be hiring something like 3500 people this year. But for us--everyone on the distribution list--finding talented people is about the easiest thing we can do--I know *tons* who are looking for interesting places to be. And almost everyone that I know says that they're \"planning to start up in a year or so...\" but just looking for the right opportunity.\n\nAnd so Tom suggested that we just take a look at what the best biz schools and engineering schools in the country are (Stanford Engineering, Stanford GSB, MIT Engineering, MIT Biz, HBS, CMU Engineering, Cornell Engineering, Cornell Biz, Princeton Engineering) and try to figure out how to build a business built around collecting the right groups of people together.\n\nWhich brings us to the actual idea:\n\nA metastartup (this is a temporary name only--trying to think of a better one) is a company who's mission is to foster a community of talented engineers and business people, with the goal of spinning off startup companies from that community, as well as to build a loosely coupled network of those companies.\n\nI believe that there will be very many types of flavors to a metastartup--a couple have already emerged:\n\nIdeaLab (http://www.idealab.com/): This is a company in Pasadena founded by a guy named Bill Gross. The basic idea is that he's got lots and lots of ideas for startups, as well as a whole bag of money, and is recruiting anybody he can get his hands on to come work on one of his ideas to start up. I think that they've got 18 companies in their portfolio after a couple of years. He basically sets people up with offices, HR functions, ideas, a team, and VC. Check out [www.herring.com/mag/issue...](http://www.herring.com/mag/issue44/gross.html,) which is an article from The Red Herring.\n\nInterval Research (http://www.interval.com/): Interval is a research tank of about 100 people, created by Paul Allen, and funded from 1992 to 2002 by $100M, I think. It's mostly composed of relatively famous designers who have made their marks in the computing industry, although there are quite a few artsy types there as well. Their business model is to be really free and loose and let their researchers work on whatever they want, and to spin off ideas whenever it seems appropriate. They've got 3 spinoffs to date: Carnelian (software for traditional publishers), Purple Moon (software for girls) and Electric Planet (also software for girls). Not a lot of public information about them; they're extremely inwardly focused.\n\nWhat I'm thinking of, though, is less patriarchal, less funded, and more egalitarian than IdeaLab, and much more urgent, much less funded, and much less academic than Interval.\n\nThe model would be to have a core set of people in the metastartup, who focus on continuity, mentoring, cross-fertilization of ideas, and recruiting, and hiring mostly young people, mostly right out of school or after their first or second high tech job, for a time period between one year and two years, with the expectation that sometime in the second year of being at the metastartup, they would find a team to join that spins off, with the metastartup retaining some equity portion of the spinoff, and the spinoff retaining some reciprocal equity stake in the metastartup (and, transitively, in every other spinoff in the community).\n\nWhich all sounds sort of neato--but the big question is obviously how to pay everyone's salaries. The revenue model that I've been working on so far has a few different possibilities. The obvious ideal is to have a few of the startups go public, which would presumably fund metastartup development for some reasonable length of time, and that's my expectation for the long term. But how to get it started? Seems like there are two possibilities (along with some versions that are mixtures of the two): venture capital funding (Tom Kosnik seems to think that this would be relatively easy to get) or self-funding, through consulting work. \n\nVC has lots of different possibilities--the major advantages would be (1) a close connection with a VC's network and (2) cash. I think that there are a couple of disadvantages: (1) you lose quite a bit of your equity when VC's fund and (2) in funded ventures, people seem to have a problem with \"keeping their eye on the ball.\" That is, when your salary doesn't depend on execution, it's easy to work on something that's not quite critical to your business. One of the guises of a VC-connection that Adam and I just talked about is that there would be the possibility of a VC deciding that this is a really good way to develop engineering and creative talent as a resource for startups, and absorb the whole metastartup as some sort of development arm.\n\nThe consulting route is clearly harder, at least at first, because of the obvious problem of splitting time between what you want to be doing, developing the startups, and what pays your bills. I think that we can mitigate this problem a bit by being sort of careful about the consulting jobs we pick (there seems to be way more consulting work in the valley than anyone can do)--and trying to position the company as a sort of IDEO, that is, an advanced research company. One possible example is that a friend of mine is the CEO of an internet startup (about 100 people, I guess), and they're really looking to build some sort of research lab to do advanced prototyping--the metastartup could contract that work out, doing market research and prototype and technology design. I have the feeling that we could find a lot of work like that.\n\nThere are a bunch of other ideas in this, but it's really late, and I need to go to bed--one more piece, though, is one borrowed from Interval, and that's the idea of people in the company having a certain number of \"project points\" that they have to spend. So, for instance, you might assign everyone 20 points wehn they start--and their main project, the one that nothing takes priority over, is worth 12 points, a consulting project is worth 5 points, and smaller roles on other people's project might be worth 2 or 3 points each. That's a neat idea for at least 3 reasons---it helps cross-fertilization of talent and ideas, it gives us a way to measure % of time spent bringing in dollars, and it would give us a way to involve people at some level less than a full employee--you could imagine hiring \"associates\" or something that don't quit their day jobs, but get involved at the level of 5 points or so--this would be a risk reduction way to get people involved and engaged. Better than that, though, is that it would provide a way to get students still in school involved--to have associate groups at Stanford and in Boston, for instance, of students spending some % of their time working on metastartup stuff--which could be anywhere from contributing ideas from their scholarly work to doing actual consulting work. Seems like that would be a really strong hook for recruiting.\n\nThe last thing that I'll say tonight is that I believe that the metadata idea could provide a way to get away from the \"startups-that-make-the-three-founders-and-only-them-rich\" category, by focusing on building a very egalitarian group, with very open policies on equity and salary.\n\nAnyway, more tomorrow night, hopefully, but I wanted to get this started at least, and hopefully get reactions to it.\n\nThanks--\n\nJohn\nlilly@research.apple.com\n",

				"content_text": "<p>[warning: esoteric nerdism follows. sorry about that.]</p>\n\n<p>I'm a little confused about how to deal with e-mail these days. One complication is that I'm moving from my Reactivity account to a personal account. Another complication is that Eudora, my e-mail client, hasn't changed for years, and is now getting to the point in its lifetime where it sucks a little bit. Now, how we each deal with e-mail is a bit of a personal thing, but some of you may know that I'm a little bit on the OCD side with respect to this. For my own e-mail, I've got virtually every e-mail that I've sent or received since I went back to Apple in 1997, and I've got most of my meaningful e-mail from my time at Trilogy and even Stanford archived off somewhere. And I'm a little particular about how I file things. In Eudora, for example, I have something like 1,000 different mail folders (not joking. serious.), and I pretty much know where everything is. If I want to go back and see something that I wrote to a customer, or a VC, or a friend, I can pretty much navigate directly to it. And I'm relentless about cleaning out my inbox -- once I'm done with something, I file it in the appropriate folder and it's gone. So my inbox at any given time is maybe 8 - 10 messages.</p>\n\n<p>But here's my problem: most people don't use e-mail that way. If you walk through your office and look at people's Microsoft Outlook inbox, I can almost guarantee that at least half of them never take anything out of their inbox -- they just have everything there (or delete it) and do searches on their \"big-ass in box (BAIB)\" to find what they're looking for. I believe that this BAIB effect is directly attributable to the fact that's actually pretty cumbersome to file things in Outlook -- lots of clicks.</p>\n\n<p>Combine that with a 2nd major trend: Google-style searching. Search is getting pretty good lately -- and the UI is pretty simple: a text box and a \"Go!\" button. The success of Google has pretty well convinced folks that their UI is right, too. Which is why you're seeing Microsoft and Apple simplify search to a simple text field, too. Turns out this may not be bad -- it's getting to where search is very very fast. Fast enough, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>So those two trends have meant that new, modern mail clients -- I'll count Mozilla's Thunderbird, Apple's mail.app, and Google's GMail in that category -- all basically assume a very small number of folders (1's or 10's at most) and a lot of searching. </p>\n\n<p>I've decided to give in. I've switched to using Thunderbird with just 2 folders (InBox, Archive) for my main mail client, and GMail as my web client and backing POP store. I no longer have a \"Kathy\" folder, or \"Reactivity -&gt; Clients -&gt; Fidelity\" folder or anything like that. Now I search. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure how I feel about it, though. Sometimes in Eudora I'll go look back at things that I wrote years ago -- conversations that I had with Kathy when she was in Jamaica, or with my dad when I was at Stanford and we were both learning to use e-mail come to mind. This makes it harder. But I have a sneaky feeling that it may be harder now in any case, just because of the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">sheer volume </span>of e-mail we're all dealing with now.</p>\n\n<p>Who knows. Times change.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of other random thoughts about applications I've been using:</p>\n\n<p>1) Mozilla Firefox is terrific. Great job on the browser. </p>\n\n<p>2) I was forced by USAA to upgrade to Quicken 2005, from Quicken 2004 (at least they gave me the upgrade for free). I used to like getting new versions of Quicken every year. Now I'm pretty sure they're done. No more changes, no more releases needed. Enough.</p>\n\n<p>3) I'd like iPhoto on Windows. Picasa (owned by Google) does some of it, but not as well. Not as nice.</p>\n",

Good book, but just discouraging.

I've been to and through Houston a number of times (one of the hazards of living in Texas, really), and I can't think of a single reason to really recommend it. It's always been hot &amp; muggy, and somehow both incredibly sprawling <em>and</em> congested at the same time. The humidity/AC combo (it was 93 degrees today and wet) has the fantastic effect every time I walk outside of completely fogging up my glasses at least until I get into the car. Funny joke the city likes to play on me.</p>\n\n<p>Today I'm on one of those flights where the sun is heading towards sunset and it feels like there's a carpet of cotton candy clouds -- I find that I keep staring out and just watch. such a textured, ephemeral, layered, light, heavy, big set of feelings when you look at them like this. Lately on flights I mostly get into a mode where I don't notice the flying -- I turn on my iPod, or open my laptop, and try to get from one place to another without thinking about how silly/impossible the idea of flying big boats in the air across the country is. But just now I'm thiking that I shouldn't take it for granted.</p>\n\n<p>For all the griping that I've done about flying, it's something else entirely to think about how my grandfather lived, driving from town to town in the south. The idea that I can wake up Monday at home with Kathy, end up in Houston, spend all day Tuesday in meetings, then be home in time for a late dinner with Kathy again is amazing. A nice luxury to be sure. I suspect that I don't get to know the places that I go as well as I'm sure my grandfather did, driving through them, and that's too bad -- when I think about his trips, or read books like <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> or Steinbeck's <em>Travels with Charley</em>, I can't help but think that we've gone out of touch with a sense of place. It isn't just flying, of course. It's also the Interstates and the Internet, McDonald's and Border's, things like that. On the other hand, I'll be awfully glad to be at home tonight with Kathy.</p>\n\n<p>Then tomorrow off to Detroit. Another place that isn't incredibly high on my list of destinations.</p>\n",

Some of his revelations are big, most are small -- and that's probably most of the point. I think it's a little bit like the first couple of seasons of <strong>Six Feet Under</strong>: the message in both is that life is full of mostly small moments that most people just move right past, always waiting for the bigger ones. And that when it comes down to it, if you can take the time to notice the \"small\" ones, and take joy in them because they're part of life, then things can be pretty good.

It's just the focused dialog between two characters: one wants to kill the president, the other is a little roped in.</p>\n\n<p>I was hopeful about this book, mostly because I feel like there are things that we're not \"supposed\" to discuss lately -- and that as a country we're playing increasingly fast &amp; loose with the truth -- talking about the \"spin tactics\" of modern political parties like they're legitimate and that the way they're doing it is the story. The story, of course, should be that more people are lying to other people than ever before. Not really that encouraging.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, having said all that, as I mentioned, I was hopeful about this book, and it was interesting, but ultimately not that thought-provoking. You might borrow it from someone if you've got an afternoon to kill, but I probably wouldn't run out to buy it.</p>\n",

She and her husband Mike worked at and met at a company called Immersion (http://www.immersion.com) here in the Bay Area -- started by an HCI classmate of mine from Stanford.</p>\n\n<p>[Aside: Immersion pioneered in a field known as \"haptic interfaces\" -- also known as force feedback interfaces. Joysticks that push back on you, for instance -- or more generally input devices for computers that are also output devices -- that exert force that you can feel. They're most widely deployed in gaming technology, but the most interesting thing they're doing has to do with the medical field -- a couple of use cases spring to mind. The first is sinus surgery simulation -- they've built a system that lets medical trainees practice sinus surgery on dummies -- they've built tools that make it feel just like you're operating on a real person. The 2nd is remote surgery -- if you can simulate what it feels like to be doing an operation, you can enable a surgeon to do it with video, audio &amp; feeling. Neat.]</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the wedding was great, and I think Kathy &amp; I both really fell in love with the whole Vancouver area. It's sort of like Seattle, but really more like its own thing. First, it's just green, green, green. And blue. Tons of evergreens, tons of water. Very pretty. When we got there, it was a little overcast, but the weekend was otherwise amazing. Leaving the airport on Saturday at lunchtime we drove to the ferry &amp; rode the 90 minute trip to Vancouver Island, where our friends Byron &amp; Lise live (in Sooke). Victoria is the biggest city on Vancouver Island -- about 300,000 people -- we spent the afternoon there, just watching folks -- there were a number of events going on, like a local boatshow. Turns out that Victoria is the provincial capital of BC, and has the buildings that make you think of Canadian capitals (big castle-style buildings with green copper roofs -- sort of <br>\nlike the railroad hotels, too).</p>\n\n<p>On Sunday Kathy &amp; I spent some time walking around downtown Vancouver, which is a very \"funky &amp; fashion-forward city,\" Kathy kept saying. Lots of cool clothes, lots of little coffee shops. And always views of the water. Natalya's wedding was in the afternoon in a botannical garden (what other types are there?) in South Vancouver, then the reception was in the Pan Pacific Hotel in downtown -- the only 5 star hotel in Vancouver, and just beautiful, right on the water. Nice day.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday (Labor Day, even in Canada!) we spent the morning walking around Stanley Park (presumably named after the same Stanley that the Cup is named after) -- it's a very large park right downtown -- we walked the 7 mile loop around the park, all of which is right on the water. They were having the Vancouver Triathlon there right at the same time, so it was sort of fun to watch everyone competing. After lunch, we drove up to North Vancouver, to a brunch reception at Mike's house, then off to the airport &amp; home.</p>\n\n<p>Great trip, and a beautiful place. We'd go back anytime.</p>\n",

I tend to be a little bit jaded &amp; cynical in my own life, so I found the little descriptions of pretty banal situations uncannily accurate and interesting. At the beginning of the book, I felt the same feeling I did when I read <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Microserfs</span> -- that it was exactly my life. But it started to go off track.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, I find that the book was only okay. The first 100 pages or so is quite good; the last couple of hundred, though, tend to get a little bit repetitious and even more cynical than I was prepared to be. Don't get me wrong -- cynical is great when it's funny -- but when it's not funny, it's just sort of mean, and that's where this book got to eventually.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This is a great book! It's a short book, written by a frequent contributor to NPR, all about candy. He talks about his own candy addiction for a bit (always has between 3 and 8 pounds of candy in his house -- actually gives a rundown of the candy in his house when he was writing the book). Talks a lot about the candy that he remembers from his youth, how it all evokes such strong memories. Lots of interesting history and stories about the candy industry. Did you know that Snickers Almond is basically rebranded Mars bars? Or that while Americans love milk chocolate, most of the world loves dark chocolate? And that that was an effect of Mr. Hershey introducing and marketing milk chocolate starting at the Colombian Exposition in Chicago in the late 19th century? [Aside: another book that I've read this year that's relevant here is called <strong>The Devil and the White City</strong> -- all about the Colombian Exposition -- great book. Shredded Wheat was introduced at that fair, as was Alternating Current. Momentous.]</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, in the really magical part of the book, Almond writes about taking tours of a number of regional candy makers -- companies that are still straining to stay alive. Consider the Twin Bing -- a cherry candy made in Iowa. Or the Idaho Spud, produced in its eponymous state. [When Kathy and I were in Montana, I was **thrilled** to find Idaho Spuds at a convenience store in the middle of nowhere. Until I took the first bite. Ugh. Some sort of marshmallow/nougat/coconut concoction. But you've got to give them credit for trying.]</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, it's a short book, easy to read. And it really will bring back all sorts of memories. Big tip: he mentions that the absolute best candy bars that he found during his trip are the Five Star Bars, by Lake Champlain Chocolates. You can get them at Whole Foods, or by writing away for them. Absolutely delicious.</p>\n\n<p>The book's only real flaws, in my opinion are these: (1) he has a real bigotry against white chocolate, and (2) he never once mentions the Zero Bar -- a staple of my youth.</p>\n",

The \nlast time that I really listened to that stuff was in high school, when our \nband played a bunch of it -- but it all came back to me. Actually, \"came \nback to me\" isn't quite the right way to phrase it -- I think it's all just \ninside me somewhere. The melodies and rhythms and beats all just felt \nsuper-natural to me -- and it was pretty emotional to listen to, because it \nall brought back memories of a different time for me -- I guess it was \nabout 20 years ago now, in high school. The music hit me at a gut \nemotional, no memories level, but it also was fun to think about what life \nwas like back then. How the complexities and responsibilities and joys were \nso different. It's a little bit like the occasions when I drive around \nAustin late on summer nights -- the hot, sticky air always reminds me of \ndriving after football games in high school. Nice memories.\n\nAnd a lot of times I'll end up really listening to a song for the first \ntime -- the other day I listened to Jeff Buckley's Hallelujah about 10 \ntimes in a row. (You may remember it from The West Wing, from the season \nfinale of Season 3, when Mark Harmon's character gets killed.) I had always \nreally liked the music, but for some reason on that day at that time, I \njust really paid attention to what he was doing with his voice, and the \nlyrics, and his guitar. I'm listening to a ton more music than I have in a \nreally long time.\n\nLike I said. Sublime.\n",

Which is weird, because I really enjoy the whole crew from <strong>This American Life</strong> on NPR -- just think they're all smart, funny, and generally insightful -- David Sedaris included.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I made it through this one, and really enjoyed it. Like all of his work to date, it's a collection of storied based on his life. None is longer than about 10 pages -- just all little vignettes, about growing up. I found that a lot of times I recognized his emotions exactly, more often I found myself being thankful that the family I've got is, well, not like his, and I laughed out loud a lot.</p>\n\n<p>I'm definitely going to go back and read his other stories now -- I've been thinking some lately about family and relationships -- and while a lot of his are dysfunctional, his writing holds some truths in it that I think apply to everyone.</p>\n\n<p>The funniest story in the whole book is called \"6 to 8 Black Men\" and tells the story of the Swedish Santa Claus. When you read it, it's really about different cultures and how they get along, but I thought his writing in this one was particularly sharp and funny -- made me laugh out loud on the airplane, which is a very good thing.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"http://images.barnesandnoble.com.edgesuite.net/images/8740000/8741183.gif\">\n\n<p>I was pretty blown away by <strong>The Bourne Supremacy</strong> on the big screen a few weeks ago -- thought the story was terrific, the acting was fun, and the direction was really great. I knew that the filmmakers had taken some (a lot of) license with the story, really just keeping the character of Jason Bourne. But I had such a great time at the movie that I thought I'd pick up <em>The Bourne Identity</em> from the bookstore and do a re-read.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the first thing you should know is that I read most of this while I was on the tarmac at Chicago-Midway airport with nothing else to do during a very very long delay. So I was a captive audience, so to speak. They were playing some very bad Jennifer Aniston movie in an attempt to placate us, so I just tried to escape into the book.</p>\n\n<p>And I'll tell you that it pretty much worked. What a great character, what a great beginning to a story. There's a bunch of detail that I don't want to give away, of course, but very near to the beginning of the book, there's a scene where the main character, Jason Bourne, who's suffering <br>\nfrom amnesia, goes into a bank in Geneva to open up a safety deposit box and try to remember a little bit of his former life -- and as you might imagine, things don't go extremely well for him. The book starts running at this very early point and doesn't really slow down until the end. Jason <br>\nBourne is one of the very best espionage-era characters that I can remember, and this early scene is one of the best (it's reproduced in a terrific way in the movie, too, although a little different).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I'm very happy to have read the book again -- it was really entertaining. One thing that was interesting is that it was written in the late seventies -- so fairly close on the heels of the Vietnam War. For me, born in 1971, the Vietnam War is more historical than anything else, and I've never really known anything different than a pretty cynical view of this particular war -- but it was interesting to read a book that was written close in time to the actual event.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing that always strikes me when I read books like this that are 20-30 years old is the massive difference in information technology. These stories would be so different with Google and cell phones, and e-mail in your pocket. And yet the human story basically still works.</p>\n\n<p>Only downside to the book is that it tends to drag a little bit in the middle -- there's a lot of running around Paris that probably doesn't need to happen for quite so long. If I hadn't been on a plane, I might have gotten stuck.</p>\n\n<p>But a fun read, all in all.</p>\n",

Ferguson makes the basic argument that, apologists to the contrary, America is in fact an empire. [An interesting aside is that he cites a source that claims the US is the 68th empire in world history, with Communist China being the 69th and the EU as the potential 70th.]</p>\n\n<p>Niall argues that empires, while they have negative connotations in today's environment, actually provide a number of benefits: the rule of law, generally higher quality of life, generally higher economic performance -- things that our world desperately needs now.</p>\n\n<p>Most interestingly, he comments that when the US acts the most like an empire (consider Hawaii, Puerto Rico), the results for everyone concerned are almost always better than when we do something halfway (Cuba, the Philippines). In the situations where we are imperial to begin with but don't have the will to continue (Cuba, for example, and now Afghanistan and Iraq), we pull out of the country prematurely, before a stable government can be established, and it tends to result in repeated military interventions over the years.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it's an interesting book. I found myself really disliking the topic when I started reading, but agreeing with it more towards the end. I'm not sure that everything he writes makes a ton of sense, but it's a smart book, with an interesting point of view, and absolutely worth reading.</p>\n",
