			 <p>My uncle Andy Korb died about a month ago. I already miss him a lot — and a ton of other people do as well. His passing has left a big hole in the world. This weekend we’re going to Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, where he and Aunt Susan have lived with their two sons, Pearce &amp; Drew, for as long as I can remember (they were married 50 years!)</p>
<p>Andy was my Mom’s brother — Mom was the oldest of three, Andy was the middle child, and Alan, who turns 70 this week was the youngest. Their parents, my grandparents, who became named Bampa &amp; Gigi, settled on St Simons Island, Georgia, where we’d go for holidays from time to time, and Alan &amp; Andy eventually each found their way about an hour south on I-95 to live near the beach outside of Jacksonville.</p>
<p>This family was full of nerds: engineers, and readers, and practical jokers. Bampa had served in WW2 and come home to get his engineering degree, then to work on the early space program in SoCal and Alabama with Werner von Braun before heading to St Simons to run his own engineering firm.</p>
<p>See if you can spot the rocket engineer in the pic below!</p>
<p>￼￼</p>
<p>Yeah, not too tricky to find Bampa there. That’s me, just trying to hold it together, sitting with Mom, with Dad behind. Bampa giving off some extremely Dilbert vibes in the back. Gigi in the front, and I think her mom in the pink (she looks super happy to be there, but kind of looks like that in all the pictures I can find). Alan, maybe still in college in the back. And Andy, with his incredible mustache and blue steel gaze on the right.</p>
<p>Visits to St Simons and Jacksonville were always fun and challenging and full of games and shenanigans. Here&rsquo;s another essential St Simons moment: Andy with the classic bunny ears for Bampa. Right behind him on the wall (you can&rsquo;t see them in the pic) were 3 portraits — one each of my mom, Andy and Alan, that Bampa had signed by the early astronauts for them. Those made a big impression on me for a long time, really honoring and elevating the role of intellectuals and engineers and explorers in our world.</p>
<p>Mom &amp; Dad got married and Mom got her degree in finance &amp; accounting. Andy went to Rice to get a chemical engineering degree. Alan got his mechanical engineering degree from Georgia tech. Gigi did a lot of things, but mostly I remember the bookstore she owned &amp; ran, called The Shorebird, where I would happily go spend many afternoons lost in one story or another — I just couldn’t believe I was lucky enough to have a grandmother who had access to so many books. Like I said: this family loves math and words. So much.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Andy. He became an engineer and following in Bampa’s footsteps opened up Korb Engineering of Florida, which he ran until he died. He was a polymath, able to figure out the engineering on just about anything — he designed tons of things for clients all over. And he was always curious about how things worked, and wanted to talk about how they worked to anyone else who was interested. You couldn’t spend any amount of time with Andy without learning, learning, learning. But with so much playfulness and humor too.</p>
<p>Our family grew, as they do — Andy &amp; Susan had twin boys Pearce &amp; Drew, who now are both married with kids of their own. Alan &amp; Diane had kids of their own, my cousins Blake, Harrison &amp; Chandler, and later Alan &amp; Mary Kay raised a blended family with Kitty, Jamie &amp; Lana. The kids had kids, and so on and so on.</p>
<p>Andy &amp; Susan’s house in Ponte Vedra Beach was the undeniable center of gravity for the family. Every holiday I can remember was there — it was always full of our family, and Pearce &amp; Drew’s friends from school, and other friends from the neighborhood. The overwhelming feeling of being at their house has always been of belonging — not just for a few, but for everyone. They were always happy we were there, and it always felt like home to me. Kathy would feel the same way as we got to visit as adults. But the incredible thing is that nearly everyone I’ve talked with there felt exactly the same way. There was always just warmth and acceptance. Kathy &amp; I talk a lot about that now — how it was that Susan &amp; Andy built that over so many years — and how we strive &amp; aspire to be like that in our own lives.</p>
<p>One of the truly spectacular qualities about Andy is that he always always always made sure to tell you he loved you, and that he was proud of you, and to act in ways that communicated he believed in you to do even more. He sent everyone books a lot — he sent me lots of math books that he was pretty sure I would really like (he may have believed in me too much in that regard, as I didn’t always understand them!). He loved hearing stories about all the behind the scenes stuff in Silicon Valley — like I said, he always loved understanding how things worked. During Figma’s IPO a few weeks ago, one of the poignant parts for me was that he really would have loved to hear about the day.</p>
<p>A few weeks before he died I got to spend a little time talking with him — longer story, but his son Pearce &amp; his family happened to be in town and we were able to help with a couple of things — and so I was catching up with Andy about some of it. He told me about a shorthand for these situations he had: “I’m on my way.” It came from a situation a long time ago when my uncle Alan needed help with something or other. The way that Andy tells it, before Alan could really even finish describing the situation, Andy just said “I’m on my way.” He didn’t ask if he needed help, didn’t weigh the other things on the schedule that day. Didn’t even really ask Alan if he wanted him to come over at all. Just said he’d be there. And he was. Andy I talked a few weeks ago about how that’s the essence of what we’ve always tried to communicate to our own boys. This is one that I myself don’t always get right — I tend to problem solve and overthink things sometimes. But his simple framing — I’m on my way — has really unlocked a lot for me about how I’m trying to be in the world.</p>
<p>And then, as always, he told me that he loved me and was proud of me, and that he missed my mom an awful lot.</p>
<p>So. There’s a big hole in the world without Andy here. But! He leaves so much behind to fill that space, too. Susan &amp; Pearce &amp; Drew &amp; Alan &amp; nieces and nephews &amp; friends &amp; neighbors &amp; so many people who laughed when they were with him, and felt loved, and felt believed in.</p>
<p>Being that way, showing up for family &amp; friends in the full way that Andy always did — that’s a daunting aspiration, but it’s an awfully good road map for living that Andy gave us, and I&rsquo;m very grateful for the time that we had.</p>

			 <p>Today’s IPO is a landmark moment for Figma — not just a financial milestone, but a powerful validation of Dylan and Evan’s founding vision back in 2012: to “eliminate the gap between imagination and reality.” </p>
<p>Figma’s relentless focus on product, community, and craft has reshaped how the world designs. What began as a bold technical challenge — building a web-based design tool that felt native — evolved into a platform that helps millions of creators design and build together.</p>
<p>In a 2003 interview about the iPod, Steve Jobs famously said, “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” Figma is built around this idea, building tools so that designers of all kinds come together not just to make things beautiful, but to make them work better.</p>
<p>And now, we’re standing at the threshold of a new era — one defined by the rise of artificial intelligence. It’s an especially important moment to ask: what does the future of design look like?  </p>
<p>Design has always existed in the space between tools and human intention. As Mitch Kapor wrote in his 1990 Software Design Manifesto: “What is design? It’s where you stand with a foot in two worlds — the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes — and you try to bring the two together.”</p>
<p>35 years later that’s still the clearest expression I know of what great design strives to do. And it’s what Figma enables: a connection — between imagination and reality, and between the systems we build and the people we build them for, between our machines and ourselves.</p>
<p>On a personal level, too, this is a significant moment for me. I was lucky early in my career to be mentored by some of the best thinkers &amp; designers in the world: Terry Winograd &amp; David Kelley at Stanford; later Mitch Kapor &amp; many others. And from the very first time I set foot in Figma’s offices, I felt like I’d come home: Dylan &amp; Evan had built a temple to design — with typography books scattered around — but the whole company culture was infused with a belief in, and reverence for, designers and their work. And that’s still the core value of Figma today. </p>
<p>One of the other things that Mitch said to me about entrepreneurship is that “you’ve got to build a house you want to live in.” In other words: build organizations that can help create the world you want. By elevating and empowering designers, Figma’s done that in a profound and lasting way. </p>
<p>Here’s to the team at Figma, and to continuing to build the world of designing together.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve blogged very much &ndash; or even really tweeted very much &ndash; and I miss it, so I&rsquo;m going to start again.</p>
<p>I used to blog all the time &ndash; I started 20 years ago (!) when I had just about left my own startup, Reactivity, and hadn&rsquo;t yet joined Mozilla. I was reading a ton and playing a lot of World of Warcraft, and getting ready for our first son Sam to be born,  and was doing a lot of thinking about the first 10 years of my career and what I wanted for the next 10 and the 10 after that. Blogging was kind of new, and it was a really fun time just to learn to express myself on the internet &ndash; really just doing it to help myself think and learn.</p>
<p>And it turned out to be very useful professionally as I joined Mozilla &ndash; I started blogging more about the open web with posts like <a href="https://johnolilly.blog/2007/06/14/a-pictures-worth-m-users.html">this one that got a fair amount of attention</a>.</p>
<p>I must have had a lot more time back then, because I wrote <em>a lot</em>. But it was fun, and I was trying to figure out what I thought about a lot of different things.</p>
<p>Twitter started in 2006 and I started tweeting pretty soon, and that was something completely new &amp; alive. While blogging was post &amp; response, Twitter was really quick conversations, about just about anything. It&rsquo;s hard to explain to anyone who wasn&rsquo;t on it in the late 2000s, but Twitter really had the feel of hanging out at a bar with your friends after work, but way richer. Over time I would blog a little bit less month to month and tweet a lot more, and it stayed that way for awhile.</p>
<p>Over time, my attention span got shorter &amp; shorter &ndash; the kids came, social media became more pervasive, and as I&rsquo;d become a VC at Greylock, my attention was naturally pulled between a million different competing interests. The other thing that happened for me specifically is that since I was meeting one to two thousand companies a year, I felt like my head was suddenly filled with ideas that weren&rsquo;t really mine to share.</p>
<p>And honestly social media started sucking a lot. I still got a lot of use and enjoyment from it, but it definitely was starting to show really problematic signs in the early 2010s and kind of went off the rails in the second half of the decade &ndash; politics, disinformation, tribalism &ndash; it all just sort of sucked. That coincided at a time in my life when I left Greylock and started thinking about what to do next, then&hellip;covid.</p>
<p>Since 2020 I&rsquo;ve been off the map a little bit in a lot of ways, dealing with lots of the things you deal with as you work your way into and through middle age: parents, kids, siblings, friends, sense of self &ndash; stuff that&rsquo;s often pretty tough to write about as you&rsquo;re going through it &ndash; not to mention some of the stuff I&rsquo;ve been involved with at the board level of Figma, Duolingo, Nuro &amp; more.</p>
<p>But what really got my attention is that in 2022 my 17 year old son Sam was diagnosed with leukemia. We think he very nearly died that week, but he&rsquo;s good now, after some very tough and scary times, and some extremely high quality medical care &ndash; but it completely dominated our lives for a couple of years, and we&rsquo;re still processing it in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>Anyway. So now I find myself at 54 wanting to write again, to go back and figure out what I think about some things again. I don&rsquo;t know what the cadence will be or the topics, although there are a few that are kicking around in my head.</p>
<p>As Thomas Wolfe wrote, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go home again&rdquo; &ndash; but I think writing more, trying to extend my attention span, working to create more than react &ndash; that&rsquo;s what I plan to do for awhile. I&rsquo;ll have to experiment with where to post this stuff &ndash; right now I&rsquo;m posting to my own blog, and some distribution to Bluesky, Threads, (maybe but likely not for long) Twitter, Facebook (maybe?).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see!</p>
<p>Thanks to Harper for all the help and encouragement getting set up. I&rsquo;ll leave the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">Yak Shaving</a> description for a little bit later. (Also, it might be <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding#English">Bike Shedding</a> that I&rsquo;ve been doing. It&rsquo;s tricky to tell.)</p>

			 <p>After 8 years as a General Partner here at Greylock, I’ve decided to step back to be a Venture Partner. The Venture Partner title means different things in different situations, but here’s what it means for me: I’ll continue to focus on working with existing portfolio companies as an active board member to help them grow and thrive, but I won’t be looking for new companies to invest in. These are companies I’m in love with and excited about: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Caffeine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Figma<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crew<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Angle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and one more that I backed last year but haven’t announced yet.</p>
<p>For those of you who know me personally (or via Twitter, I guess!), you know that I care an awful lot about improving the state of our country and world, and it’s crystal clear that 2019 &amp; 2020 are crucially important years — certainly the most important time in a generation, but maybe much longer than that. I’ve been on the board at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Code for America<!-- raw HTML omitted --> working on this for several years, but lately have wanted to spend more of my time in this area — so that’ll be one area that I will ramp up. In fact, I’ve also just taken a board role at a new non-profit startup <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Voting.Works<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, led by my friend &amp; former Mozillian Ben Adida. Their mission is to build new, secure, affordable voting systems that all Americans can count on. I’m excited to be able to spend more of my time &amp; energy towards this kind of work.</p>
<p>My time as a GP at Greylock has been challenging and rewarding and fun and interesting and above all a great privilege. And while the work that I really love doing will continue, I want to take a second to note that I’m grateful to my partners here, and to the entrepreneurs I’ve gotten to work with along the way.</p>

			 <p>I talk &amp; write about &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->finding your tribe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; a fair amount &ndash; knowing &amp; understanding &amp; nourishing my own has been critical for me many times over the years.</p>
<p>This week I was reminded how important it is &ndash; our family went to an annual gathering that we&rsquo;ve been going to for about a dozen years now &ndash; long enough that I can&rsquo;t quite remember when we started. It&rsquo;s hard to describe the grouping of people &ndash; it&rsquo;s a mix of different people with different professions and perspectives &ndash; Silicon Valley and Hollywood and New York and D.C. and lots of other places. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter where they&rsquo;re from &ndash; what matters here is that it&rsquo;s probably the closest IRL manifestation of how I conceive of my own tribe of people. Not complete, for sure &ndash; lots of folks who are important to me aren&rsquo;t there &ndash; but representative.</p>
<p>Over the past decade plus, we&rsquo;ve all gotten older and changed. Gotten married, had children, gotten divorced, changed jobs, started companies, changed the world.</p>
<p>What I was struck by this year is how all these relationships have developed over the years. These are people who have seen each other at highs and lows; who have worked shoulder to shoulder with each other on too many projects to mention, and against each other on some, too.</p>
<p>The special thing about having that much context, and people around who know &amp; believe in you is how much they can frame the year that&rsquo;s past, and the year ahead.</p>
<p>Your tribe has the context about you &amp; your life &ndash; and can remind you, when you need it, of who you are, and who you can be.</p>
<p>And beyond all that, it just feels good (and restorative, and challenging) to come home once a year, and see friends &amp; allies, and tell all the old jokes, and just listen about where you&rsquo;ve each been, and plan about what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<p>I enter 2019 grateful for this communion and connection, and reminded again how important it is to find your people, and keep investing in them always.</p>
<p>Happy 2019 everyone.</p>

			 <p>Today I hit a milestone which is totally arbitrary, but is a meaningful one for me personally: I achieved my &ldquo;Move&rdquo; goal on my Apple Watch for the thousandth time since I got my first Apple Watch in May, 2015.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to me because it&rsquo;s enabled, or at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->least, coincided with, a pretty dramatic change in the way that I live day to day, and even more dramatic change in the way that I think about myself. Before 2015, I got to the gym a couple of times a week, but always struggled with consistency and achievement. I&rsquo;ve gone through some periods of my life where I&rsquo;ve been more consistent &ndash; training for a half marathon about 15 years ago, for instance &ndash; but I&rsquo;ve always had a hard time with it, and more than that, have always viewed it as a little bit separate to my life.</p>
<p>But I like games and competitions and goals and streaks. So the idea of trying every day to hit my goal of physical output has worked for me in a big way. It hasn&rsquo;t been 100% &ndash; otherwise I would&rsquo;ve hit 1,000 a year ago &ndash; but it&rsquo;s been consistent, and when I get out of sorts and miss a few days (or few weeks), it&rsquo;s something powerful for me to come back to &ndash; for the past few years, I&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wanted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to get back to it, which is totally new to me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been some other pieces that have been useful &ndash; we got a Peloton a few years ago, and I can&rsquo;t recommend it highly enough &ndash; it&rsquo;s an amazing and transformative piece of equipment, and, astonishingly, it&rsquo;s proven durable.</p>
<p>And this year I got my diet into shape for the first time in years, which meant my year on the scale looked like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m up a little bit over the past few months, but after getting some guidance from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dr Suhas<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in February, everything got better. As good as it&rsquo;s ever been for me, actually. Lots of people are amused that it was an Ayurvedic diet that unlocked things for me &ndash; not exactly a tradition that I come from &ndash; but my point of view is: whatever it takes. It helped my weight, lowered my cholesterol, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->helped my head<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Lots more to unpack &ndash; and some work to do going forward, as I&rsquo;d like to get down under 160 (and am pretty sure that I can) &ndash; but mainly I just wanted to write about this arbitrary milestone, and what it means to me, and say that I&rsquo;m grateful for this little piece of technology on my wrist that keeps me honest and motivated.</p>

			 <p>Well.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been way more than a year since I&rsquo;ve blogged. I think longer than I&rsquo;ve gone without writing since I started blogging something like 15 years ago. I can&rsquo;t tell you exactly why it&rsquo;s been so long, but think there have been a bunch of things in my life happening over the past 18 months that have all added up.</p>
<p>For one thing, it&rsquo;s been a little busy. Tons &amp; tons of stuff going on at work &ndash; a few new things I can&rsquo;t talk about yet, lots of help with company building at the ones I&rsquo;ve talked about in the past, and just a busy time in the markets overall. Raising 2 boys with my wife has kept me pretty busy as well &ndash; they&rsquo;re getting bigger &amp; more capable all the time, and between school, soccer &amp; Fortnite (alas, FIFA time has fallen way off), we&rsquo;re pretty busy on that front as well. And lots of (totally fine) health stuff going on, including an appendectomy, losing 30+ pounds (unrelated) and a few other things.</p>
<p>I think, too, that the state of our country, and the state of our own particular corners of the media world (like Facebook and Twitter) have simultaneously taken a lot of my attention, but also have really been discouraging. I&rsquo;m not sure that will get better anytime soon, but I have really ratcheted down posting on and reading Twitter and Facebook, and only vomit in my mouth after reading Politico once or twice a day. Progress? 2017 &amp; 2018 have been a little weird. I&rsquo;m thinking 19 &amp; 20 might ratchet that way up, too.</p>
<p>But now it feels like time for me to write again. Every day if I can get after it. But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll push everything to Twitter or Facebook. Maybe once in awhile. I mentioned to some friends the other day that back in the mid-2000s, the first time I saw Joi Ito&rsquo;s site &ndash; the mix of posts and WoW info and Dopplr whereabouts, etc &ndash; I thought to myself: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Joi&rsquo;s home online.&rdquo; And then I went off and built my own straightway. I moved through Typepad and Wordpress and Tumblr Medium and Twitter and Verst and a lot of other places online, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve really been an Internet nomad over the last decade or so.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a hole in our current online lives &ndash; there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;home&rdquo; for any of us anymore. I hope that someone is building that now, with everything we know about how the internet has evolved, and how it feels in 2018. I&rsquo;m looking for it myself.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;m going to get back to writing. Probably about the same old things &ndash; the Internet, apps, books, raising a family &ndash; because, well: fish gotta swim. It&rsquo;ll take some time to get back into the groove and write much that&rsquo;s worth reading, but that&rsquo;s cool too. For me, the act of writing illuminates and clarifies, and mostly just makes me happy.</p>
<p>Feels good.</p>
<p>PS &ndash; the image at the top of the post is my 13 year old&rsquo;s last soccer game of the season, which happened today. Watching the boys play, and develop into teammates and leaders, is my very favorite pastime. There&rsquo;s a simplicity and power to starting out every season anew, building a team, and just focusing on getting better every time you go out.</p>

		<a href="https://johnolilly.com/2017/07/25/figma.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-07-25 23:05:03 &#43;0700">Jul 25, 2017</time></a>

			 <p>I’ve been interested (and obsessed, really) with design for my whole career, stretching back to the early nineties when I got to work on early human-computer interaction at Stanford. A lot’s changed since then — the rise and dominance of the Internet; then the absolute ubiquity of phones and other connected devices — because computing has permeated every facet of the way humans live, intentional design has become a necessity for just about every product.</p>
<p>But for all that the orientation towards and understanding of design has changed, the technology we use to design hasn’t really. Despite advancements in cloud computing and graphics processing, most design tools have remained stubbornly stuck in the 90’s. Designers must run them locally on their computers, syncing to file storage services and exporting inert versions to share with collaborators. In other words: in a world of collaboration, design has remained a stubbornly solo activity.</p>
<p>This has never been a great state of affairs, and more than that it just doesn’t work at any scale at all. As technology companies grow, and the reach of the products they make extends, workflows to create those products are getting extremely complicated — it’s generally a mess of hacks to allow basic communication among engineers, marketers, product leaders and designers. Which means that companies like Airbnb are employing entire teams of people to build custom software to make this work.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And so: design becomes the bottleneck to great companies’ growth, instead of what it should be — the driver of their success.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There’s a big opportunity here, which is why in 2015 I was so excited to invest in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Figma<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the first collaborative design tool that runs in the cloud. From the beginning, Figma had a lot of things going right for it. It broke down barriers to collaboration between teammates because it ran on any operating system, its files are always up-to-date, and multiple people could work together in real-time.</p>
<p>But in the first version of Figma, it fell short on a few key areas — prototyping (for design feedback and user testing) and developer handoff (so engineers could pull the data they needed from design files).</p>
<p>These aren’t optional features — designers need ways to communicate their work quickly to people in other departments and receive their feedback.</p>
<p>Before now, they’ve relied on hacked-together systems that are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->painful<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Plugins loaded on top of plugins cause design apps to freeze and crash whenever there’s an update. Presentations go out of date as soon as they’re exported because they’re not tied to the actual design file. And of course everything gets much more complicated as groups and companies grow — the number and type of stakeholders grow, and everything gets slowed down.</p>
<p>That’s why the next chapter of Figma’s business is so significant. Today the company announced Figma 2.0, with prototyping and developer handoff integrated into the design tool itself. That means that for the first time, the entire product team can work together in one live, always up-to-date environment for ideation, design, prototyping, and code delivery. No other design tool today offers this.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take a fortune-teller to see that this is the future. Virtually every other creative activity has moved to the cloud &amp; the collaboration that it offers.</p>
<p>It’s well beyond time for design to follow suit. Computing and interactive devices like phones now power much of the underlying fabric of our society, and so the demands on designers and product teams are become larger and more acute every day. More than that, though, every company that builds digital products today must become a design first company, designing products with intentionality. And so every company needs tools and workflows that let everyone in the process be part of the process.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Figma 2.0<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is an awesome new release— go check it out.</p>

			 <p>With the news of Robert Pirsig&rsquo;s death last week, I&rsquo;ve picked up <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to reread it. It was an important book to me growing up &ndash; it helped me think through my own value system and also to think through technology and its relationship to ourselves and our communities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slower paced book from a slower paced time. It was originally published in 1974, when I was just 3 years old, and 2 years before Apple was founded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a cliche (although true) to talk about how relevant books like Postman&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amusing Ourselves to Death <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Technopoly, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->McLuhan&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The Medium is the Message, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Orwell&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1984, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and Huxley&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brave New World <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are today &ndash; but this book of Pirsig&rsquo;s seems (to me) to capture so much of the tension between technology &amp; progress &amp; self.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll quote an early passage at length. The author is taking a cross country backroads motorcycle trip with some friends &ndash; he is himself a very capable motorcycle mechanic and loves the work of keeping his bike running well. But he&rsquo;s puzzled by his friends' relationship with technology.</p>
<p>Long passage follows. Pretty sure I&rsquo;ll post more as I slowly work my way through this rereading of the classic. Lots of these thoughts keep rattling around in my head days later.</p>
<p>What is it they say about history? That it doesn&rsquo;t repeat but it often rhymes? I&rsquo;m sure feeling that a lot these days, for better or worse.</p>

			 <p>In just a decade since the introduction of the iPhone, our mobile phones have become the dominant technology we all use in our everyday lives. We send messages (text, pictures, video) all day long, every day. It’s no exaggeration to say that the way we communicate with each other has changed fundamentally over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>And so it’s no surprise that the way we work has also changed dramatically. We text and chat with our colleagues and rely less on email and in-person meetings. We work on projects collaboratively and at the same time, not independently and behind closed doors.</p>
<p>But the focus of software innovation for the way we actually work — our core productivity — has been mostly for the benefit of knowledge workers in desk jobs that look a lot like our own in the technology industry. Productivity software is an area that I really love, and over the past few years I’ve invested in software companies like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Figma<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quip<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dropbox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that have dramatically advanced how (desktop &amp; laptop) computer-centric workers create, share and collaborate with one another.</p>
<p>What about industries like retail, healthcare and hospitality, where most workers aren’t working on their laptop all day?</p>
<p>Messaging is a behavior that is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->already happening<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for most of these teams — but it’s via some awkward mix of text groups and social platforms that aren’t really built to help co-workers be more productive. These approaches are ad hoc, chaotic, and unloved since they blend personal and work lives, and are generally impossible to manage from the employer side of things.</p>
<p>This is why I am so excited to share the news that Greylock has led the Series B in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crew<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I have joined the board.</p>
<p>When I met co-founders Danny Leffel and Broc Miramontes, they told me story after story about the people who use Crew to get work done — people on teams who aren’t well served by our traditional computing-centric tools, but still need to communicate and organize with each other to be successful in their own work. Within just a few minutes in that first meeting, I knew we’d found a team we wanted to work with who was on an important mission. Productivity is bigger than helping folks do their desk jobs more efficiency. It’s about everyone, regardless of industry, being on the same page so they can do their jobs better.</p>
<p>The beauty of Crew is that it connects workers in the way they’re already connecting, via messaging. With Crew, everything and everyone is in one app, and colleagues can swap shifts, change schedules, request time-off and coordinate on daily tasks and responsibilities. When you lower friction to participate and communicate — just like our mobile technology has done in the rest of our lives — interactions across team members are simplified, teams stay organized, and people feel more engaged.</p>
<p>High performing teams across the board — from grocery stores to fire departments — are already using Crew to share schedules, cover shifts, and communicate with each other. In just under two years, there are more than 10,000 active organizations sending over 10M work related communications on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>Everyone needs — and deserves — to have technology that can help them work more collaboratively within their teams and do their jobs better. Danny, Broc and the Crew team are building something really important and I’m very happy to be a part of their journey.</p>

Answer: comes from the Latin &ldquo;cadere&rdquo; which means &ldquo;to fall&rdquo; &ndash; like a drumstick falling on the beat.)</p>
<p>When companies start, the founders are usually going as fast as they possibly can go. Founders can often finish each other&rsquo;s sentences, and in the early days they can get huge parts of the product and business created without much coordination with each other at all. As companies add people, this gets harder and harder to do &ndash; so you start do create process as a way to help more people lead in the organization. But processes sometimes have natural rhythms, sometimes they don&rsquo;t. It takes intentionality to get them to line up with each other &ndash; and over time, to be able to increase pacing (and overall output of the organization).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we talked about today in class &ndash; the slides I used follow. They&rsquo;re designed for an interactive session (and the HR282 students had a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ton <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of great material to add) &ndash; but you&rsquo;ll get the gist.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been blogging since 2004, and have always loved the freedom of expression and the ease of distribution. Blogging has given amazing super powers to anyone anywhere in the world who&rsquo;s got something to say. But even as it&rsquo;s gotten more powerful over time, it&rsquo;s also become more challenging to keep up to date with all the tools and options.</p>
<p>Over the years, in addition to using just about every type of publishing software around, I&rsquo;ve also invested in different platforms that help people share content in various ways (notably Tumblr &amp; Instagram). In 2015, I invested in DWNLD because of their focus on solving a big problem for professional publishers — with the rise of mobile &amp; social (especially Twitter and Facebook), professional publishers didn&rsquo;t really know where to put their “home” on the web. DWNLD focused on offering a smart and easy way for publishers to build and maintain connections with their audiences through creating their own dedicated apps. When we first invested in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DWNLD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I said:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The DWNLD team saw these trends very clearly and so over the past year have built on their base technology for easy but powerful publishing (enabled by machine learning on the back end) and built something new. Today, they are introducing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verst<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the company and the product name), a new platform that’s purpose built for the unique needs of professional publishers.</p>

			 <p>The other day I wrote a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post about how 2017 has felt to me so far and how I&rsquo;m trying to manage my own psychology<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t about that. This one is about what I&rsquo;m actually paying attention to, and what I&rsquo;m doing about it. (And what I&rsquo;m trying not to focus on.)</p>
<p>[Side note: I&rsquo;m using the first person singular in this post, but a lot of it &ndash; most, really &ndash; is shared between Kathy &amp; me.]</p>
<p>Here are the areas I&rsquo;m thinking the most about (in no priority order):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, here&rsquo;s what we (Kathy &amp; I) are doing: we&rsquo;re picking a few (fewer than 5) things to really focus our time, effort &amp; expertise on. We&rsquo;re picking as many things to support financially in these areas of interest as we can, too. And then we&rsquo;re trying our best to stay focused on that set.</p>
<p>As for the things we&rsquo;re doing actively:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But these are the areas of focus that so far have made the most sense to Kathy &amp; me. Undoubtedly some will change, and some will increase.</p>
<p>None of this is as tight or focused as I&rsquo;d like it to be. But that&rsquo;s just the reality of 2017.</p>

			 <p>I haven’t been writing a lot lately. Partly because it’s the beginning of the year and a lot of (really uniformly amazing) things are going on at work. Partly because Kathy &amp; I have two young kids at home who need (&amp; deserve) a lot of our attention. Decidedly not because of how great the Stanford men’s basketball team is.</p>
<p>But the real truth is that I’m having a hard time coming to terms with what’s happening in Washington, D.C. and our country more broadly.</p>
<p>Someone asked me the other day how I’m doing — my reply was, “Oh, you know: read crazy Trump tweets first thing in the morning, work it off in a workout, work during the day, rage tweet at night. Normal.”</p>
<p>But I check Twitter a fair amount during the day, and it’s not ever for great reasons. I read a lot of Politico, and Washington Post, and NYT. In the car I’m listening to tons of CNN, MSNBC, NPR, and Fox News (holy shit). I even peek at Breitbart, just to get a glipse of the raging garbage fire going on over there. I read the news at night and want to read every angle. I go to sleep, but wake up every night around 2a or 3a thinking about what’s going on.</p>
<p>So yep. I’m struggling.</p>
<p>I’m functional, and I think making progress at home and work — but I’m so distracted. And clearly not healthy w/r/t my media consumption.</p>
<p>It’s easy to articulate why: I am, and always have been, an American exceptionalist. I believe that for all our increasingly obvious faults, there are many, many things that make the United States, and the American experience, unique in world history, and I’m very proud of who we are and how we work. But I’m also a globalist, and want our whole world to improve — the thing I love about America is how hell bent we’ve been on being so inclusive and diverse. Again, the flaws, including our original sin of slavery, are obvious. But I’m an optimist (even though many people read me as a pessimist), and I’m an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->American optimist <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more than anything else.</p>
<p>So it’s hard to watch so many of our core institutions under attack. Every day we can see the work of Jefferson, and Washington, and Madison, and Hamilton, and Lincoln, and Roosevelt, and on and on — trampled on with such disregard by the current occupants of 1600 Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>I’ll write more about all this in the coming days, not that anyone needs any more hot takes on what’s going on. I’ll write about some of the things that I’ve been getting involved with and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actually doing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to protect and nurture the values of our country.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to write again mostly for myself, though.</p>
<p>It’s been hard not to be snarky or negative or weak or unsure. I’m all those things most every day, and I don’t really want them to reflect in my writing. (My tweets are another matter — snarky is pretty much what I’ve got!)</p>
<p>But for now I’ll end this with a bit of a breakthrough mentally I had last week — and it came from the unlikeliest of people, Mitch McConnell (who I think is probably the worst, most obstructionist and damaging lawmaker of my lifetime.)</p>
<p>It came when Elizabeth Warren was reading Coretta Scott King’s letter and McConnel shut her down with Rule 19, saying “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about that word: persist.</p>
<p>And how it relates to another word of so many Americans right now: resist.</p>
<p>[Nerd alert!] I love etymology, and was thinking about these two words and their roots. “Resist” comes from the Lating roots “re” (meaning against) and “sistere” (meaning to stand) — so of course means <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to stand against. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And there’s a lot of standing against our goverment that needs doing right now. Persist comes from the same base word meaning stand, but with “per” — meaning through. Stand through. Be steadfast.</p>
<p>For me that simple switch, from thinking about resisting, to thinking about being steadfast — that’s made a huge and positive difference for me. Because instead of just standing against this awful administration and being defined by them — instead of that, it’s about the idea of being steadfast to my own — our own — values, and holding them tight and inviolate. It’s not about bouncing these people out of power, although that needs doing. It’s not about raging against this dumb law or that insane executive order.</p>
<p>Rather it’s about continuing to build our families and communities and businesses and governments, and holding our values steadfastly.</p>

			 <p>I had an opportunity this week to speak on a panel to some newly elected members of Congress about technology policy, and it was an interesting and positive experience.</p>
<p>I won’t go into all the things we discussed (although not difficult to imagine) since it was off the record, but I started off by quoting David Foster Wallace in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->commencement address at Kenyon College<!-- raw HTML omitted --> some years ago. Starts off with a joke:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This isn’t a new idea, of course. Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman figured it out ages ago. The medium is the message, &amp;c.</p>
<p>But the degree to which it’s true now is, I think, is more extreme than ever, and it’s been sneaking up on us for awhile. Facebook &amp; Twitter, Snapchat &amp; Instagram — they’ve all changed the way we think and work. And this will sound insane, but to a significant degree, I think we really don’t understand most of the implications.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the time we don’t even really totally grok that there’s nothing natural or inevitable about these particular communication patterns at all. They’re constructs that flow from how the technology works, and they have strengths and weaknesses just like any other medium does.</p>
<p>Anyway, my more prosaic point was just this: there really isn’t any “technology policy” anymore. It’s all just policy. Technology is so foundational to how we work and how we think that it always has to be considered as part of a broader fabric.</p>
<p>If you have time, go back and read that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->speech by Wallace<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It’s one of the most thoughtful and self aware speeches I’ve ever come across, and I read it myself often. It seems relevant in many, many ways as we gratefully and nervously draw a close to 2016.</p>
<p>I read it just to remind myself:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of weeks ago I attended a reunion for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stanford CS198<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — the program at Stanford that runs undergraduate section leading/teaching assistants for the introductory CS classes there.</p>
<p>I’ve said many times that deciding to be a section leader was probably my best career decision ever — no exaggeration. It’s been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->instrumental in creating a ton of great leaders over nearly 3 decades now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>We’ve had a couple of other reunions over the past few years — they’ve been amazing to attend because there are just so many incredible and inspirational people who have gone through the program since its inception.</p>
<p>But this particular reunion was special for another reason: it was also a celebration of Eric Roberts, for many years the faculty sponsor of the program, and a huge driver of so much in the 25 years he’s been at Stanford. He’s retiring soon, and so we got to celebrate his many contributions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway, it’s a humbling group to be part of (both the speaker set and the program more generally), and I was grateful and honored to have a chance to offer a few thoughts.</p>
<p>Here’s what I wrote (as per usual, about 50% different than what I actually said…):</p>
<p>I was never lucky enough to take a CS class from Eric, but I have to imagine the feeling I’ve got right now is a little bit like I would’ve felt turning in a Karel assignment. Excited &amp; kind of nervous.</p>
<p>But really: this group — Stanford CS, and CS198 in particular — is probably the group of people I am most at home around and most comfortable with in the world. CS198 is the source of many of my longest and best friendships, and the source of my longest and most productive working relationships. And of course an awful lot of that was made possible by Eric. Just in case you think I’m exaggerating, I counted: 2 of my cofounders were section leaders; 5 out of our 7 first employees were section leaders. And 3 out of 12 of the companies I’ve invested in since I’ve been at Greylock. Plus: two of my groomsmen for my wedding. It’s no exaggeration when I say that deciding to be a section leader, and later getting the opportunity to be a coordinator — those are 2 of the most critical turning points of my life.</p>
<p>Looking back on things, I guess I actually got to Stanford in 1989 about a year before Eric came as an Associate Professor, when the also extraordinary Stuart Reges was building the foundations of CS198 — then we all went through the weirdness and dislocation when Stuart left Stanford — but I don’t know if anyone knew then just how lucky we were that Eric was already here, ready to build 198 into something essential and foundational to Stanford Computer Science and to Stanford University itself.</p>
<p>I applied and became a section leader right around the time Eric took over the program — Scott and Astro turned me down the first time I applied but things worked out on my second. Once I was in the program, I really, really loved it, and eventually applied to be coordinator. Didn’t get it — Sandy Nguyen did. Tried again 2 quarters later — nope! Felix got it. Just to be perfectly clear, Eric made the right call both times — Felix and Sandy were both amazing. Still, I loved the program and applied one more time, and still remember when Eric called me to offer me the coordinator job — I was over the moon, and loved every minute of my two quarters with Felix. My two quarters with Bryan Rollins were also fine.</p>
<p>Talking with Mehran, we figure that since Eric has run CS198, more than 25,000 students have gone through the 106s; and that well over a thousand people have been section leaders. And maybe a few dozen of us have been coordinators, although I’m pretty sure we each contributed more than our fair share of Eric’s gray hairs during our terms — or at least I’m pretty sure that Bryan and I did anyway. In a real way, Eric’s work has had an impact on virtually everything and everyone in our industry.</p>
<p>We’ve all learned so much from Eric along the way. About computer science for sure, but also how to find such joy in the science &amp; the engineering, in the learning &amp; teaching &amp; communion of the group. The environment that Eric made possible is one that values students taking leadership and responsibility for the betterment of all. And Eric paid attention to and valued and contributed to diversity long before really anyone else was thinking about it, let alone doing something about it.</p>
<p>Beyond the computer science and beyond the classes, more than anything else, Eric helped create an environment and a community where each of us in it wanted to be as good as we could be, and we wanted everyone around us to be even better. He helped so many of us find our calling and our voice that it’s really hard to even get your head around.</p>
<p>As important as anything else: Eric helped to teach us meaningful, lasting self-efficacy: how to teach each other and learn from each other and value and rely on each other — something that lasts even now.</p>
<p>I am more than certain that CS198 has an incredibly bright future with Mehran at the helm — but I know, too, that we will miss Eric greatly. His intellect and enthusiasm and commitment and warmth and humanity are genuinely special. We’ll all miss him a lot, for sure, but this community of excellence that he helped create, and these relationships we all have together will persist for a very long time, and I just can’t really express how grateful I am for that gift.</p>
<p>Eric, thank you, and good luck with your next chapter.</p>

			 <p>My mom is visiting us this week and we were talking about machine learning and artificial intelligence — what it can do, what it probably can’t do, and implications. Because, you know, it’s 2016 and that’s what we talk about when we’re not talking about Donald Trump.</p>
<p>(For whatever it’s worth, I’m kind of burying the lede on this one — long windup to get my way to conclusions. Sorry!)</p>
<p>Anyway, I made an offhand comment to her that we’re in the very early days of this evolution — I wasn’t really talking about AI <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per se<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but more just about how software is running more and more of our world, and that’s a phenomenon that’s likely to accelerate, and for a long time — and that as a consequence, there’s going to be an increasing supply &amp; demand imbalance in software talent. We just don’t have enough talent to write all the systems that need to get written, and for the moment, that means that we’re getting profound concentrations of talent — especially in AI — at companies like Google, Facebook, Apple and others. I don’t really think that concentration of talent is a permanent state of affairs (and, in fact, my job is an explicit bet to the contrary), but it sure is true right now.</p>
<p>As we were talking about all this, something else I’ve been mulling over for awhile finally clicked in my head, and that’s the story of the picture at the top of this post — that’s a picture my dad took in Quitman, Georgia, where he grew up, of his grandfather Pappy’s cotton gin.</p>
<p>Here’s what my dad wrote recently about his recollections of the gin and his adventures in the 1950s:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>He wrote more about it — but in these few paragraphs you can see how much Dad learned about how things work from Pappy and the gin (and other unrelated engineering explorations).</p>
<p>You can see, too, what an amazing system the cotton gin itself was, and how it changed the way people worked. The modern cotton gin was invented by Eli Whitney in 1793 (when George Washington was president!) more than 150 years before my dad got to explore Pappy’s.</p>
<p>When the cotton gin was invented, many people thought that it would reduce our new nation’s dependence on slavery by removing the painstaking work of separating the usable cotton from seeds, hulls, stems, etc.</p>
<p>But ironically, it resulted in the growth of slavery.</p>
<p>The gin could process cotton so efficiently that more cotton goods could be produced, and it turned out that there was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->massive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> latent demand for cotton goods. So while the robots did indeed reduce the reliance on slaves to do the finishing work, they also increased demand for cotton, which resulted in many more cotton fields, and many more slaves to tend them.</p>
<p>I don’t know enough history to know whether this was a core issue that led to our Civil War or just a contributing factor. Probably somewhere in between. But it took us more than 100 years to really process all the implications of just this one technology advance (and I think really you’d argue that we haven’t fully come to terms with them even today.)</p>
<p>So you see where I’m going with this.</p>
<p>Fast forward to our own era, and we’re working our way through software automation instead of cotton processing automation. And it seems obvious to me that as we’re making systems and processes easier and easier to automate, we’re also generating massive new previously latent demand for software driven systems.</p>
<p>I’m not arguing at all that this will result in anything like the growth of slavery in the first half of the 19th century — more that we’re in a time of profound change. And that worries over whether robots will take all our jobs I think will prove to be ultimately misplaced. I think that if you look not just at the cotton gin, but most technology automation advances what you’ll find is that the demand for labor nearly always <!-- raw HTML omitted -->increases<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So for my part, I’m not particularly worried that we’ll find ourselves in a world where there’s nothing to do.</p>
<p>But the jobs will surely change, and we’ll need to learn how to do different types of things in our schools. And our society will change. There will be winners &amp; losers. There will be painful dislocations. There will be (more) clashes between technology &amp; policy. It’ll take time for us to come to grips with these changes, and many people simply won’t ever adjust. The changes we’re going through are that fundamental and dislocating. There’ll be tone deaf Silicon Valley titans — same as ever. There’ll be tone deaf leaders in Sacramento and Washington and our governments — same as ever.</p>
<p>And those are the narratives that are prevalent now: thoughtless Ayn Randian libertarians in Silicon Valley versus inept and hopeless government.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But here’s the really good news: the narratives are interesting and handy, but I don’t think particularly representative of where we are and where we’re heading. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our industries and our government are not as homogeneous as the stories.</p>
<p>We’re learning how to talk about what’s happening — things like Tim O’Reilly’s WTF conference for example. And we’re learning how to govern in a technologically sophisticated way.</p>
<p>It’s happening at the federal level with the work of Megan Smith, our country’s CTO, and DJ Patil, Ed Felton and Alex Macgillivray, US Deputy CTOs, built on the excellent work of Todd Park and many others.</p>
<p>And also at the state and local level, pioneered by many, but notably by Jennifer Pahlka and others at Code for America.</p>
<p>Ultimately, like other transitions of magnitude, this is going to take us generations to really &amp; truly sort out. But I’m encouraged by the fact that more people than ever are talking about what’s happening, and governing in new ways.</p>
<p>One of the things that I learned at Mozilla from Mitchell &amp; Brendan &amp; Chris &amp; so many others is that we could make the world that we wanted. That meant first doing the hard thinking about what it was that we actually wanted. And then being intentional, debating and disagreeing but also building.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1003&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;768&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Photo by Carl Heyerdahl[/caption]</p>
<p>Anyhow, that’s my net: now is the time we are all experimenting with what software and technology and automation can do — and that means that now is also the time that we should start figuring out what we want the world to look like. But it’s all an election that’s less coherent, and harder to get a handle on than red states &amp; blue states and electoral college math.</p>
<p>This election is taking place every single day in software, in laws, in our government, in how we live and how we consume and the choices we make. There’s no single Election Day, no single tally. It’s ongoing and constant, values embedded in the systems we build.</p>
<p>Make sure you vote.</p>

			 <p>I’m extremely happy to be able, finally, to talk about a product we’ve been quietly working on for more than two years: Ozlo.</p>
<p>I introduced Ozlo’s co-founders Charles Jolley and Mike Hanson to each other in 2013 when Mike was an Entrepreneur-in-Residence here at Greylock — coincidentally, the same year that mobile internet usage exceeded the PC.</p>
<p>What they noticed then, to paraphrase Louis CK, was that “…everything was amazing, and everybody was unhappy.”</p>
<p>Everything was amazing because the combination of smartphones and the global cloud meant that we had access to just about any information in the world, all the time.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But everyone was unhappy because we were still mostly searching for it like it was 1999.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We were typing tons of keywords into search boxes. Still sifting through lists of blue links. Still trying to find information embedded inside web documents instead of accessing it directly. As a result, we weren’t asking our phones some of the most basic &amp; simplest questions — we’d all been trained only to ask things that we thought might be “Googlable.”</p>
<p>Mobile is different, and the interactions and questions and answers should be different, too. Our phones know a lot about where we are and what we’re doing. We’re only paying partial attention to them — we’re out in the world and distracted, not focused like with PCs. We mostly use our phones to communicate — not at all like traditional search engines. Above all, when we turn to our phones with questions, we want answers <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fast.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It seemed clear that there was an opportunity to build something more modern — higher signal for our mobile lives, much faster to get to information, but mostly just better able to answer the questions we actually have when we are out in the world, living our lives.</p>
<p>So Charles &amp; Mike got started. They built Ozlo, which is launching today as an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iOS app<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but will eventually have many more ways to interact with him. Ozlo lives on your phone and answers questions like, “Where can I find good coffee within walking distance?” Traditional search engines would struggle with a question like this. That’s a point that’s worth emphasizing — even in 2016, traditional search approaches aren’t great at answering basic human questions.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here’s a post from Team Ozlo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that shows you a a few things about how he works and what it can do today. At the moment, Ozlo knows about restaurants &amp; foods — over time he’ll learn about more domains.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Ozlo for some time now, and watching him learn and improve nearly every day. I use him because he offers genuinely useful information just about every time, and because he does so <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very quickly — generally with just a tap or two, and often in less than a second.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I haven’t really found anything else quite like it (and believe me, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’ve looked<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)</p>
<p>I think it’s unique partly due to the design and partly due to the deep technology stack that Team Ozlo has built. The design stands out for me as the best example of a conversational interface that I can find. Ozlo’s not a command line bot; it’s deeper and richer. He’s also not pure text — or rather, he can be sometimes, but also will use more sophisticated UI elements when he’s able, like in this native app. Ozlo gets the back &amp; forth exploration of a real conversation. He knows things about who I am and what I like. And his interactions are fast &amp; fluid in a way that feels natural and native.</p>
<p>The technology stands out because the team has blended approaches from the worlds of search, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and even interactive fiction — it’s a full stack developed to build rich conversational experiences, and it shows.</p>
<p>We know that we’re still on the very early part of this journey — lots more to build, and lots more to teach Ozlo about over the coming months and years. So consider today’s product a down payment on the future — a system that’s useful now and will be more useful tomorrow &amp; the next day &amp; the next one after that.</p>
<p>They’re opening up a few thousand slots today on the beta list, so if you’re interested in using Ozlo and helping it learn, and being on the journey, head over to sign up at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ozlo.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>On a very personal level, I’m extremely proud of Team Ozlo. Charles and Mike first set up shop in the Greylock offices and proceeded to build a first rate team of search, AI, language and design builders — no surprise since both Charles and Mike are exceptional in their ability to innovate and build complete systems from data &amp; algorithms through to new types of user interfaces. I’ve known both Charles and Mike for years, and really love working with them and the Ozlo team.</p>
<p>Ozlo provides something new: a quick &amp; easy way to have a conversation about the world around you, supported by an extremely deep technology stack. It’s hard to overstate how difficult it is to make something so challenging <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so simple, and it’s great to finally be able to share it with the world. (Or maybe not the whole world just yet, but, you know, lucky beta users — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->go sign up<!-- raw HTML omitted -->! 👊)</p>

			 <p>I’m just back from a family vacation in Washington, D.C. It’s one of my favorite places to visit, and always overwhelms me on a number of dimensions.</p>
<p>We went this spring for a few different reasons, but in large part because we thought it would be a good experience for our 10 year old son in the run up to the 2016 election.</p>
<p>Although, honestly, we booked the tickets well before the primary season became a raging dumpster fire. There’s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more to explain to a 10 year old than you’d really prefer this cycle, honestly.</p>
<p>Anyway. It was a good trip. One highlight for me was spending time in the Jefferson Memorial, a space that I love.</p>
<p>In the photo above, on the right you can see the immortal words from the Declaration of Independence, which Jefferson authored at the age of 33.</p>
<p>But I was happy to be reminded of another of his less well known quotes — on the left in the picture above:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Jefferson wrote these words in 1816, about a decade after he was president, and 40 years after writing the Declaration.</p>
<p>I find the political debates of 2016 so tiresome, and more than that, genuinely troubling. Originalism, conservatism, literalism.</p>
<p>Fine, okay: the work of our founders — and so many re-founders of our country over the centuries like Lincoln and MLK and countless others — was monumental, and much of it has stood the test of time.</p>
<p>But society progresses, and we learn, and we should evolve in turn.</p>
<p>And Thomas Jefferson knew that even 200 years ago.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last year at Stanford University, Reid Hoffman, Allen Blue, Chris Yeh &amp; I taught a class on entrepreneurship at Stanford called “Blitzscaling” — a strategy in which a company (most often technology companies here in San Francisco &amp; Silicon Valley) pursues unusually high rates of growth in a way that’s tactically inefficient in terms of capital and other resources, but strategically essential to capitalizing on a large and attractive market opportunity.</p>
<p>The class went well, and included tons of amazing insights from guests like Eric Schmidt, Marissa Mayer, Reed Hastings and Sam Altman, plus many others.</p>
<p>So today we’re making the entire course content — all 20 class lectures — available via podcast on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iTunes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SoundCloud<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pocket Casts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stitcher<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>[embed]<a href="https://soundcloud.com/greylock-partners/blitzscaling-01-overview-of-the-five-stages-of-blitzscaling-1">soundcloud.com/greylock-&hellip;</a>[/embed]</p>
<p>“But wait!”, you think — it’s 2016 now — isn’t the era of crazy growth over? Aren’t we back to a more sober time?</p>
<p>The recent turmoil in the markets that has affected many technology companies — both public and private — may indeed lead some to conclude that the aggressive pursuit of growth needs be restricted to buoyant markets. But even today, those who choose to limit their pursuit of growth to favorable market conditions are forgoing potentially valuable opportunities.</p>
<p>The key nuance to keep in mind during these mixed market conditions is that a company’s rate of growth needs to be measured on a relative — rather than absolute — scale. In a rapidly growing market, a company that grows 100% per year might be losing share; during turbulent times, a company that grows 50% per year might be gaining enough share to achieve market dominance. You can successfully blitzscale in good times, and you can successfully blitzscale in bad times. But you can’t and probably shouldn’t blitzscale all the time.</p>
<p>Companies should adopt a strategy of blitzscaling when tackling a market in which becoming the first player to achieve scale confers strong and lasting competitive advantages. Blitzscaling is unlikely to prove successful if another company has already achieved the “first-scaler” advantage, or if the market itself doesn’t offer compelling sources of lasting competitive advantages, such as network effects. During the Dot Com era, both Amazon and Yahoo attempted frontal assaults on eBay’s auction business, but the network effects of eBay’s two-sided marketplace of buyers and sellers meant that its first scaler advantage was too strong to overcome — and so eBay dominated their important market for decades.</p>

<p>[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;4608&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Photo from energepic.com[/caption]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Lots of mistakes get made for sure — some companies believe they’re in a winner take all space when it turns out they’re in a commodity space — in which case blitzscaling is a disastrous strategy to employ.</p>
<p>Opportunity is the primary factor when considering whether to blitzscale. It is only after a company discovers an untapped and attractive market opportunity where being first to scale confers lasting competitive advantage that it should attempt to ascertain whether it has the ability to access or acquire the capital and talent necessary to support a sustained blitzscaling campaign.</p>
<p>During the depths of the Dot Com bust, Google followed the blitzscaling playbook by using a distribution deal with AOL to dramatically expand its AdWords business. The deal, first announced in May 2002, gave AOL an 85% share of the revenue generated by AOL searches powered by Google, with a guaranteed minimum of $150,000,000 per year. At the time, Google, had less than 1/10th that amount in the bank. This may have seemed risky, given that the NASDAQ had fallen nearly 80% from its high two years earlier, and it is precisely this perceived risk that probably allowed Google to outbid the incumbent providers, the publicly-traded Overture and Inktomi. Yet while both the revenue share and guarantee were highly aggressive, Google’s improved AdWords algorithms made the deal highly profitable for both parties, and the move allowed Google to increase its revenues from roughly $19 million pre-AOL in 2001 to $347 million post-AOL in 2003.</p>
<p>No one can say with certainty what 2016 and beyond will hold — but hopefully you’ll find as much wisdom from the guests in our Blitzscaling class as we have — incredible thoughtfulness on when to push on the accelerator and how.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the podcasts!</p>
<p>Though in-class participation of our blitzscaling course was limited to 100 students, we wanted to make the lectures accessible to anyone who wants to learn more about starting and rapidly scaling a tech company. In addition to the podcasts, here are other ways you can experience the class:</p>

			 <p>Over the last few weeks I’ve been going back to some of the things we talked about during our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stanford CS183C class on blitzscaling<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last quarter — I think I’ll do a set of posts of the ~10 most interesting insights over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>But one observation occurred to me in the context of a different class that I’m teaching this quarter with Huggy Rao and Sujay Jaswa at the GSB — titled “Startup HR.”</p>
<p>We were talking about recruiting today, and had a guest speaker from Google’s excellent People Ops group talk about how Google has recruited and grown. I think it’s fairly clear at this point that Google is among the absolute best recruiting organizations in the world. But when our guest finished his talk and Huggy asked me what I thought, I said this: “Google is an AMAZING huge company. But it’s also a HUGE company. All the stuff that they can do now in recruiting — you literally can’t do any of it as a new startup.”</p>
<p>[A side point that we didn’t discuss: understanding how big organizations recruit is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extremely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->useful in one way — it gives you a bunch of clues how to recruit competitively against them. :)]</p>
<p>That led us into a ton of productive discussion areas, but reminded me, too, to make a point that we tried to emphasize last quarter in CS183: technology companies scale very, very quickly — often growing 2–4x in employees each year. And so there are, literally, 5 orders of magnitude difference in employee scale between a 3 person startup and the 60,000 employees that Google has today. Humans aren’t really wired to understand that difference in scale, especially when it implies a much larger difference in organizational complexity (since the number of relationships in the limit is exponential).</p>
<p>What works at 1–10 might work for a while, but then totally break at 50 or 100. Technology companies nearly always go slowly for a while, and you convince yourself that you understand things. Then things start to work, and then you go very, very quickly. To make sense &amp; survive any of it, you have to have a profoundly change-oriented approach. You have to understand that any process or organization will work for awhile, then it won’t. So you go in with a sense of intentionality and thinking about what you want your organization to do at any given stage, and you try to design to that, while keeping the wheels on the bus/wings on the plane through some chaotic times.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to be said for understanding what you want your organization to look like at scale — Google is an amazing ideal model — but it’s the 5, 4 &amp; 3 orders of magnitude smaller decisions that put you into a position to play for the big.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been experimenting with using iOS for more and more of the work that I do lately — and for the past couple of weeks, have been trying to work mostly on an iPad Pro (but think the topic of hardware is a little orthogonal to the point I’m going to make here — will probably write on that in the future).</p>
<p>I’ve got a few reasons I’ve been trying this experiment. One reason is that I genuinely like using iOS, and the new split screen mode (yes, yes, very reminiscent of the one first developed by Microsoft for the Surface) makes it possible to use for most things. A more fundamental reason, though, is that I’ve felt for some time that for all but a small set of endeavors, windowed shell interfaces have not been serving us all that well.</p>
<p>We’re all extremely used to windowed systems now — stretching back to Xerox PARC of course, but also because we use them today for virtually all desktop systems — OS X, Linux, and of course the eponymous Windows.</p>
<p>They really have been workhorses, and revelations — the idea that you can have multiple applications running, see them all, drag &amp; drop between them. And for a few types of work — coding especially, but also things like presentations &amp; other types of creation where you’re pulling from a lot of different sources, especially from the web — they’ve been enabling.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;6016&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Photo by Lee Campbell[/caption]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But for most other tasks, they’re attention-diffusing — distracting for almost everything.</p>
<p>That sounds sort of strange to say, especially when I’m comparing it to a mobile OS that has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->notifications &amp; messaging built in<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But I think that the huge wins that come from not having a windowed system, with all the UX and attention baggage that comes along with window management — and the somewhat more natural integration of messaging at a fundamental level — may outweigh the challenges.</p>
<p>The proximal trigger for me was the sunsetting of Mailbox — not what I expected. But with the beta version of Mailbox for OS X, it felt like we had a good, unified mail experience that had first class support for native OS X, native iOS and native Android. Here’s why that’s important: e-mail is, still, my workhorse system that I spend a ton of time in — and using different clients on my different devices introduced some real cognitive load, I found. There are lots of amazing mail clients now for iOS — Outlook, Inbox, Spark &amp; others. Not a ton for OS X. Lots of web mail clients, including Gmail &amp; Inbox — but I find web mail pretty hard to love. Anyhow, what I found is that I liked working through my mail better on iOS (my iPad with a keyboard) using either Outlook or Inbox — way better than I liked taking care of it on my Mac.</p>
<p>iOS is decidedly not perfect — there are real issues. It’s pretty hard to pull stuff from sources like, you know, the web — without weird reliance on the camera roll — and because my iOS life is a mix of personal and work, the camera roll is a pretty weird place to have work show up in, amongst pictures of family, etc.</p>
<p>More generally, the inter application communication model is just overconstrained and underdeveloped. Even with split window, it’s a pain to use. Drag &amp; drop not really implemented meaningfully. (And actually, even split window itself not implemented well for most apps, even setting aside fundamental issues like not being able to use 2 instances of the same app side by side (like, say, a web browser).) And lots of weird issues about the mix of keyboard and touch screen support.</p>
<p>And the situation with files is really not amazing— you have to use some weird mix of cloud storage — which almost by definition is split between iCloud, GDrive, Dropbox, etc etc. So it starts to feel a little like the explosion of messaging systems themselves, where you have to remember which substrate you had the conversation in to be able to find the files themselves. Ugh.</p>
<p>Not to mention that there’s just a ton of stuff that is awkward at best on iOS right now, and impossible at worst. It’s not quite workable for everything you want to do, not quite.</p>
<p>But I really, really do like the focus that comes from being in an OS without window management. I like writing better. I like doing e-mail better. I like reading better. And I like how integrated and fundamental messaging seems, compared to OS X.</p>
<p>The more I work, the more I value focus and intentionality — and leaving windowing systems behind seems like a pretty nice step forward (to the past) to me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’m a day late writing about this, but yesterday Figma launched their 1.0, which included multiplayer simultaneous editing. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evan’s got a post that describes what they’ve done in great detail<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — it’s worth reading every word — Evan’s posts generally are amazing like that.</p>
<p>I’m really excited about this launch (and judging by the responses we got yesterday and today, lots of other people are) — for a couple of different reasons.</p>
<p>First off, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->love love love <!-- raw HTML omitted -->productivity software. We’re in an absolute golden age of software that helps us do things together. For the first time in 25 years, there’s a massive reinvention of how we create things together happening — really the first time since Office solidified into its (rough) current form in 1990 or so. From about 1990 to 2007, Microsoft held an absolute distribution advantage — because Windows was on virtually everyone’s computer (95%!), Office had an almost overwhelming bundling advantage. (Internet Explorer did as well, but for some different reasons, Firefox and then Chrome broke that stranglehold for the web in the 2nd half of the last decade.)</p>
<p>But in 2007 we got iPhones and Androids, and Office no longer had the overwhelming distribution advantage they did before — we were all reading and creating on new screens running iOS &amp; Android.</p>
<p>That move to new platforms also came with a new human behaviors and expectations: real time notifications, messaging, auto-saving to the cloud, focus on content rather than files, and a desire/demand for apps designed to fit the way we were living and working, rather than fitting the way we work to the way apps worked. And so we’ve been the happy beneficiaries of completely new systems like Slack &amp; Quip &amp; many other modern ways to create.</p>
<p>In many ways, this orientation towards messaging and collaboration also mirrored the rise of open source and collaborative development, as more and more developers started using the systems and norms and tools of open source.</p>
<p>I think we’re going to see a long boom in productivity software, including some things that look completely different than we’ve ever seen, truly matched to the capabilities of mobile &amp; cloud.</p>
<p>So of course Figma’s exciting to me as it’s very in line with those trends.</p>
<p>The second reason I’m excited about Figma’s launch is that interaction &amp; interface design is very near &amp; dear to my heart. Learning about design and HCI at Stanford changed my life — it moved me from focusing on computer architectures towards building things that humans wanted to use. And that led me to work at Apple and Mozilla and on many other adventures.</p>
<p>But design has stayed stubbornly isolated — it hasn’t undergone the same collaboration revolutions that software development and office productivity have gone through — it’s remained, basically, single player while the rest of the world has moved towards collaboration.</p>
<p>Some of that is intrinsic — designing, like coding, really, is an act of pure creation and constraints — of figuring out how to get artifact to match intent. And that very often takes place with just one human in the loop, at least for the critical parts of it.</p>
<p>But I think a more fundamental reason that design has been solo is simply that the tools have been solo — they haven’t embraced the concepts of asyncrhonous open source collaboration, or of syncrhonous messaging. A lot of the reason for that is that it’s legitimately difficult to build systems that allow this type of creation from many people who aren’t staring at the same screen. You needed robust cloud technology; you needed something like the web, and you needed something like GPUs that the web could use to make everything sing.</p>
<p>And you needed folks like Evan &amp; Dylan and the Figma team to put it all together in an exceptionally ambitious technology package that builds on the very best design traditions of Adobe (and more recently Sketch), but also opens up new areas for both asynchronous and synchronous collaboration.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there’s never been a system built quite like Figma.</p>
<p>I think for some people this will be an obviously interesting &amp; exciting cliff to jump off. I think it’ll make other people uncomfortable, with images of design by committee and bosses looking over designers shoulders.</p>
<p>It will definitely mean we need to figure some new things out in terms of how we work together. But we figured it out in other areas — with tools like Slack &amp; Github, with Quip &amp; Google Docs. I have pretty high confidence that we’ll figure it out with Figma and design, too.</p>
<p>Our experience with Figma so far has been exactly that — that it’s shorted design feedback loops, that it’s productively gotten more people in each company understanding and appreciating design, and that it’s just helping make better products faster.</p>
<p>So that’s why I’m excited, and so proud of what the team at Figma has built.</p>
<p>Achievement unlocked: multiplayer design.</p>
<p>Lots and lots of fun days and learning ahead.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like a drink of water in the desert.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That’s what it felt like to me when I got to use Quip for the first time.</p>
<p>By 2013, when Quip first launched, we were all well into the mobile age — phones and tablets ubiquitous in our lives. The stuff of mobile dominated our lives — messages and photos and tweets and likes and shares. But the way we did our work — core productivity — remained pretty mired in the 30 year legacy of Microsoft Office, or the more modern, but still desktop web oriented Google Docs.</p>
<p>Then Quip launched, and it was immediately obvious how natural it felt everywhere I wanted to work — just as simple on my phone as it was on my desktop. It felt good and usable and useful everywhere.</p>
<p>Which was no surprise, really. In 2012, Kevin &amp; Bret first shared their breakthrough insight: There was an opportunity to rebuild the core office productivity suite with modern, mobile native sensibilities and capabilities — real time messaging, collaboration, automatic synchronization — across all screens.</p>
<p>They were right, of course, and Quip immediately found a place on the screen of every device I use for work.</p>
<p>If that were the whole story, it would be a strong product with a ton of potential. But what makes Quip even more compelling is that it not only feels immediately natural and appropriate for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you want to work, but also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transforms the way you work<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over time.</p>
<p>In Quip, documents are central, of course, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so are people. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My coworkers and collaborators can see the work that I publish, and contribute. Writing this now, in fact, I’ve just shared it with my partner Elisa, who will get a notification on her phone, swipe right, and then will join in and start making this post better. Both in real-time together, but also asynchronously.</p>
<p>The more you use Quip, the more real-time collaboration becomes a part of your process. When you you lower friction to participate and communicate — just like our mobile phones have done in the rest of our lives — interactions get richer, documents get better, and cycle times get shorter. It’s magic that way.</p>
<p>At Greylock, we started using Quip years ago. It’s very hard to remember how we worked before Quip — it’s been that transformative to how we work together. We’ve observed that in other Quip customers as well — adoption starts in small groups, and quickly grows because it improves collaboration everywhere.</p>
<p>Quip has a chance to be the core productivity tool for a whole generation — something that everyone in a company will use every day.</p>
<p>It bridges extremely well from the systems that people have worked with for decades like Office, to the mobile, connected, collaborative future we all know will soon be everywhere.</p>
<p>We were very happy to be investors in Quip’s Series A, and we’re ecstatic now to lead their Series B. Quip’s a company, and a team, and a product, with the potential to transform the way we all work, and we’re very happy to be part of the journey.</p>

			 <p>I’m doing a little work preparing for our Stanford class — I’m planning to talk next week a little bit about Mozilla and how we grew — so I’m looking back through board decks from 2006 &amp; 2007.</p>
<p>Kind of amazing to look back through them. Among other things, there was no mobile to speak of. Apple was mostly irrelevant — unless you wanted to listen to music on your iPod. Gmail &amp; YouTube were still pretty new. Facebook was growing, but still early days. Twitter brand new. And if you wanted to go somewhere, you often <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rented a car<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. From Hertz.</p>
<p>Anyway, what caught my eye this morning was a slide with Firefox’s daily user growth month to month:</p>

<p>For us, in that time period, the ratio of monthly to daily users was about 3:1 — so by March 2007, we had maybe 90M users give or take.</p>
<p>[Interesting to note that that ratio wasn’t something we started out thinking about — this was a time we kind of had to find our own way to understand that that was an important ratio.]</p>
<p>Anyway, you can see that through that period, we were experiencing strong growth, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and for a product that wasn’t viral<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. More tellingly, since this was at a time before the iPhone and real smartphone adoption, we were getting very robust daily usage and growth — in a way that’s qualitatively different than today’s mobile usage, which tends to be more often &amp; more intimate.</p>
<p>But what really caught my eye was a note on the slide that said this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s dizzying, how quickly computing and technology went from ~10% of the world using it for work (and leisure, although we know much less on the weekends) to 1/3 of the world walking around with the Internet in their pockets, connected all the time, everywhere.</p>
<p>Having lived through it day-to-day, it’s easy to miss the changes — small increments, smooth(ish) change.</p>
<p>But wowowow. Quantitatively and qualitatively — it’s just a profoundly different world we are living in now than even 8 years ago.</p>

			 <p>It’s been just 7 years since Apple released the iPhone, but it seems like we’ve been doing everything with our phones for much, much longer. With mobile technology we instantly connect, transact and experience the culture. We chat. We share. We order food and rides. We instantly read the latest best seller or watch the current episode of Archer.</p>
<p>So much has gotten better with mobile technology. Which makes it all the more painful when you come across the areas that have not yet caught up. It’s not easier or better to read things from our favorite publications or brands. It’s not easier to figure out when there’s a new story on Grantland. It’s not better to go find the newest design on Design Milk. Or to check out and buy the newest pair of shoes from Adidas.</p>
<p>On the desktop, we got used to those roles being filled, at least a little bit, by our web browsers — something I had a first row seat for during my time at Mozilla with Firefox.</p>
<p>As we’ve all moved to spend more of our lives with mobile devices, we’ve seen how powerful and immediate notifications and messaging are — messaging with a friend or seeing live events unfold on Twitter.</p>
<p>But that immediacy and intimacy — not to mention actionability — hasn’t really translated for the modern mobile web. And as a result, it’s created an environment where it’s hard for publishers and fans of periodic content to connect in real time.</p>
<p>I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->knowing when there’s a new Grantland piece. Or something interesting on Design Milk goes up. But it’s been tough to do that to date, short of following them on Twitter and sorting through the Tweets to find the content.</p>
<p>Enter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DWNLD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — just about the easiest way possible to transform web content into a highly polished, great, native mobile experience. DWNLD has built an App Maker that easily and automatically generates fully branded, highly customizable native apps for both iOS and Android — even if he publisher does not have any previous coding experience. It incorporates (and hides!) a hugely sophisticated technology that analyzes and transforms web content into a first class, high performance native mobile experience, coupled with notifications, easy commerce options, and subscription capabilities built in.</p>
<p>When we first saw Alexandra Keating &amp; Fritz Lanman to talk about DWNLD, and saw the premium quality of the apps publishers could build — simply and with virtually no work — we were immediately excited to invest. That’s why Greylock is leading the series A, and I am joining the board.</p>
<p>DWNLD has figured out how to bridge the gap for retailers, publishers, brands &amp; writers, and in doing so, bridge the gap for all of us who are interested in and want to consume their content.</p>
<p>We look forward to our partnership with Alex and Fritz and the rest of the DWNLD team as they help web publishers quickly, easily, and affordably build beautiful native mobile apps.</p>

<p>I suspect that for the year they’ll sell ~20M watches, which by most standards would be incredible but by Apple’s standards will about 20–25% lighter than they would have really liked, I think. Wild guess though.</p>
<p>I do think that over time, these will get to be incredible, but will stay optional. But: more screens, more screens, more screens. All connected. That’s for sure.</p>

			 <p>I’ve told this story a few times the last couple of days, so figured I should write it down.</p>
<p>I will get a lot of flak for this, but I think that Google Docs is not very good.</p>
<p>I think it’s amazing that it works at all. But I don’t think it’s best in class for anything. Collaboration is thin. Mobile is not very good at all. And in my experience, the artifacts that get created from it are just not very good on an aesthetic level.</p>
<p>For document creation, I find Quip to be significantly better, for example, for multi-player, multi-screen, realtime collaboration. It works so well in groups and across devices — it’s just not even close. [disclaimer: we are an investor in Quip.] Slack is clearly best-in-class as well, and is changing the way we collaborate, too.</p>
<p>I look at GDocs and what I see is something amazing — something that broke the stranglehold of Microsoft Office — but not something that is very usable. I think mostly that’s because it came of age in the Web Era, before we really understood how mobile &amp; multi-screen would come to fit into our lives.</p>
<p>So I think of GDocs as a dancing bear. When you see it, you say, “Holy shit! That is a goddamned dancing bear.” That they got it working on the web at all is a bit of a miracle. But when you try to let go of that initial reaction, you end up realizing that the dancing bear’s moves aren’t all that good. He’s a little clumsy, really. And not great at the Tango at all. But: that bear can dance!</p>
<p>Anyway, I know this won’t be a commonly held view, but I look at GDocs and see very clearly a transitional product, not one that will hold up well for the ages.</p>
<p>Lots of opportunity here.</p>

			 <p>I saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris Dixon’s tweetstorm about open &amp; closed systems<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over the weekend and meant to write something quickly about it —but forgot to write — then was reminded by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this nice piece by Ev<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->WARNING!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This is a super nerdy piece. Technology, tech history, trends. But you already knew that, particularly since I put the word “pendula” right there in the title. ☺</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->TL;DR<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Nothing is inevitable. Open technologies often pervade the world, but closed networks nearly always dominate over time with distribution power. Until the Next Big Thing comes along. That Next Big Thing nearly always surprises people, because it looks like such a toy. Until it doesn’t.</p>
<p>But there’s nothing inevitable about open winning, I think. Technology systems become more open or more closed over time because people make choices and make them that way, mostly in their own self interest (writ large or small), but not always.</p>
<p>While I was at Mozilla day-to-day, when I talked about open &amp; closed systems, I would tell a story something like this: new technologies (e.g. the PC, the smartphone, the tablet, etc etc) nearly always start closed and proprietary — in someone’s garage, so to speak. It’s easier to create something completely new that’s innovative and disruptive if you control all the pieces and aren’t trying overmuch to play too nicely with others. But then over time, technology tends to open up, as the technical techniques become more widely understood, then horizontal layers come in to drive costs down, increase the variety of solutions, etc. The interesting variable in every wave, I said, was how long and messy the “middle” between the closed beginning and the open future is. And of course, Mozilla’s mission with respect to the Web (in the 2000s) was to make the closed beginning as short as possible and get everyone to open as quickly as we could.</p>
<p>But then, like Ev, I read Tim Wu’s extremely important book <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Master Switch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it affected my thinking greatly.</p>
<p>In short: I think my argument is still essentially true, but it isn’t the whole story. I now believe that technology waves tend to go from closed to open <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and then back to closed again<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with the dominant players becoming dominant based on their strength of network distribtion. In other words, you tend to go from propriety invention to Wild West open innovation and then things start to settle down again as a small number of players control the distribution of content on their own networks (nearly always based on the open set of technologies). These networks tend to be few in number, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->overwhelmingly dominant <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in their control over how people experience technology and content. Think Google for search. Facebook &amp; Twitter and now Snapchat for mobile.</p>
<p>The only thing that really unseats these entrenched networks is the rise of the next technology wave — that’s possible because successive technology waves tend to be much larger than what came before. That’s what’s happening now, with mobile completely overwhelming the previous waves of computing, becoming available to many more people, more of the time, with more touch points in their lives.</p>
<p>As an aside, it’s tough to imagine a specific technology wave that will come and make this mobile revolution look quaint — tough to imagine what technology will displace billions of people carrying tiny connected computers with them all the time — but we do know this: it will happen. It’s just the nature of communications technology.</p>
<p>Another thing that’s clear as you look at historical technology waves is that they’re getting shorter: disruption is coming faster &amp; faster. This is an intuitive result: each technology wave increases our capacity to communicate and collaborate more effectively and more quickly.</p>
<p>Companies that are dominant in one wave do not tend to be dominant in the following waves. They can be relevant, and even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extremely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->relevant, but they don’t tend to dominate in the same way. Lots of reasons for that. They’ve got existing businesses to protect. They’re built on previous models of efficiency. They get big and complex and tired. I think, too, that companies don’t dominate multiple waves like this not only because of their innovator’s dilemma issues, and not just because of the challenges of jumping from one technology curve to the next, but also because they have to go through these closed-open-closed cycles of new technology as well.</p>
<p>What’s been interesting about our current context is that a lot of this is really understood, internalized &amp; operationalized by existing huge companies — most notably Google and Facebook — you can see it in their intense innovation and acquisition pace. Mobile was an unusual wave because it went so, so quickly from proprietary closed innovation directly to distribution networks dominating, with virtually no Wild West open phase.</p>
<p>My sense of where things are right now is the same as Chris’: we’re in a period where mostly closed systems are dominant. I’m not particularly unhappy about it — it’s resulted in an explosion of innovation and creativity and objectively great value for consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>I think there are some good reasons to hope that we’ll get to more open systems again in the future — and think that’s important because as good as mobile has been, we’ve also lost much with this recent mobile native ascendance and resulting open web atrophy.</p>
<p>But I do not think that open is at all inevitable. There is no inexorable pendulum motion.</p>
<p>The pendulum will swing where someone pushes it.</p>

			 <p>A little story about Apple.</p>
<p>I generally don’t like referring to companies by their stock ticker, but today, with the enterprise value of Apple going up above $750,000,000,000 — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more than twice the value of any other company in the world <!-- raw HTML omitted -->— it seems appropriate.</p>
<p>Here’s what the adjusted stock price of Apple has looked like over the years (courtesy of Yahoo Finance):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But when I was there in 1997, a little bit after graduating from Stanford, here’s what the chart looked like:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our revenues for 1997? $7.08B.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, cash on hand was right around $2B.</p>
<p>And as bleak as that sounds, the mood inside, even after SJ came back, was worse. We took a $250M investment from Microsoft that year that felt like charity — or really felt like it was designed to keep alive some Mac customers for their Office products — if I’m being completely honest, it was that investment — from a competitor we all felt made a profoundly inferior product — that was the most demoralizing part of working at Apple that year.</p>
<p>The overwhelming narrative in the press and with the technorati — and really internally as rank &amp; file at Apple — was that we were going to get bought by Sun Microsystems. Which, I know, lots of you have never heard of. They made Java. Before that they made UNIX computers that were pretty great. (I worked there over a summer as an intern, too.) Now they’re part of Oracle. And not for nothing, but they did important work — we stand on the shoulders of giants, as always.</p>
<p>But then NeXT folks took over, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Steve started steering the ship<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and life got better.</p>
<p>Steve and the crew he brought with him, along with some amazing long time Apple folks, and many folks who came in — they changed the narrative. They killed a bunch of products and reinvented the Mac. And then invented the iPod, the iPhone, the Apple TV and the iPad. Next the Apple Watch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;2513&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Photo by Wilfred Iven[/caption]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is how you go from $2B -&gt; $750B.</p>
<p>A story for the ages. Nothing like it.</p>
<p>But also something to remember: narratives are bullshit. It’s the people who show up and build and keep going who ultimately write the stories that last.</p>

			 <p>[I originally posted this on my blog in 2011; I was reminded of it with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DJ Patil recently joining the White House as our nation’s first Chief Data Scientist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so decided to repost.]</p>
<p>It’s impossible not to think a lot about data these days. We’re generating it all the time, constantly. On our phones, on our televisions, on our laptops, in public spaces. And increasingly the best startups and Internet giants are using data to make better and better product decisions and designs.</p>
<p>Today [ed: back in 2011] at Greylock we announced that DJ Patil is joining us as Data Scientist in Residence, as far as I know the first time any VC has had a position quite like that. It’s a huge addition for us, and the expression of a bunch of deeply held beliefs about the state of the art in designing great products.</p>
<p>But as I talk about using data for design, I find that there’s a lot of misunderstanding about it — some people have the sense that it somehow makes designers less powerful, that you’re basing decisions based purely on mechanical measures rather than designer intuition and genius.</p>
<p>In my view, however, data is what makes designers not only strong, but primary. It’s what turns designers from artists into the most important decision makers in a company, because it’s understanding the data that lets you understand what your users are doing, how they’re using (or not using) your products, and what you can be doing better.</p>
<p>It made me think back a bit to my own training as a UX designer (we called it HCI then) at Stanford in the mid-nineties, when the field was just starting to develop. We would spent a lot of time on ethnography, need finding, doing paper prototypes and then doing basic mockups and user testing. And we’d get 80% of the way there then go and build it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;4193&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Photo by William Iven[/caption]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Nowadays, the state of the art is to still do need finding and some mockups early, but to get to a working prototype as quickly as you can, that’s instrumented so that you can tell what’s happening and figure out whether you’re on the right track or not.</p>
<p>I think that’s generally the right approach, but it’s worth noting: instrumented prototypes can really only get you to local maxima — they can help you find ways to tweak and optimize the basic design you’ve got, but they can never help you find a radically different and better solution.</p>
<p>So when I talk about using data — and I talk about it a LOT — what I’m talking about is a mixture of the artisan/designer-led designs along with using data to figure out what’s best.</p>
<p>Thinking about it the other day, I was reminded of one of my favorite sayings that I learned from Bob Sutton: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Fight like you’re right, listen like you’re wrong.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Bob’s an organizational theorist, and what he means is really a paraphrase of something that I think Andy Grove said, which is that he wanted all his people to have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strong beliefs, loosely held. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In other words, he always wanted people to come in with a point of view — a design, as it were — but to be willing to moved off of that point of view in the face of data.</p>
<p>So the modern, design oriented framing is this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I wish we taught more of this blend, because all of the products we use would get better.</p>
<p>So: design like you’re right; listen like you’re wrong.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Tiffiniy Cheng and Holmes Wilson, the founders of the group are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->amazing. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I haven’t met Evan, also featured in the article yet, unfortunately.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don’t know anyone who is better at activating and working the Internet to get to outcomes. I really truly believe they are peerless at this.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>They have an incredible clarity of thought and action, and a very unusual understanding of how to use the Web to get people to collect, and agree, and to act.</p>
<p>In a tech world that’s full of articles mostly focused on unicorns and financial valutions, it’s profoundly encouraging to me that Tiffiniy &amp; Holmes &amp; Evan, and many others like them (ones that I’ve been involved with at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &amp; the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Participatory Culture Foundation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &amp; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Code for America<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but also many, many more) are working and thriving.</p>

			 <p>I’m not really a religious guy at all. But I like Christmas a lot, especially with the family. And there are some Christmas songs that I really, really love. “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” is one of them. I love the optimism and the imagery, even though I don’t really wonder much about whether God is dead or not.</p>
<p>After hearing it last night (and this neat cover by Echosmith), I was curious, so looked up the origin, and learned it was based on a poem written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in 1863, in the dark days of the American Civil War, and the poem had some lines that aren’t in the song: “The cannon thundered in the South And with the sound the carols drowned Of peace on earth, good-will to men!”</p>
<p>I had no idea. But I love how the song starts from despair, turns to hopefulness for peace.</p>
<p>For me, it’s not about God, but about humanity, and as MLK Jr might say, the long arc of the moral universe, bending towards justice.</p>
<p>Happy 2015 to everyone.</p>

<p>And I’m wondering, too, from the heart of the boom — from Palo Alto and San Francisco — whether the country is starting to split into two in a way that will prove to be irreparable.</p>
<p>This isn’t an original thought, for sure. It just feels more acute to me than ever.</p>
<p>I tend to be an optimist, especially as relates to issues of our American republic. I think the work of the founders, and especially Madison and the Constitution, is unrivaled in human history, and has shown to be robust under many, many pressures over time.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>I read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this editorial in the New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today, about how uncivil, disrespectful, unconstructive we have been these last 6 years. And it’s just depressing, what our civil life has become. So awful &amp; inhumane. And so much about obstruction and taking. Not about building a better society.</p>
<p>And all I could think of was Dickens. Trite, I know. But sure feels to me like where we are:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If that doesn’t describe today’s America, I don’t know what does.</p>
<p>Obviously it’s not a hopeful comparison for today, given that Dickens was writing about the years leading up to the French Revolution.</p>
<p>And for the record, I don’t think that we’re there. But I do think that it’s increasingly clear that the greatest work of our times — and the great opportunity to do the most good — will be centered around repairing these rifts, these divides between race, between rich &amp; poor, between the influential and the voiceless.</p>
<p>And I’m hopeful &amp; optimistic that a new generation of heroes and role models is emerging to take up that work.</p>
<p>But there’s so much to do. We are miles from home.</p>

			 <p>Tonight on the way home from an event in San Francisco, 101 slowed down to a stop right around University Avenue (named for Stanford University, in case you’re not familiar with the area).</p>
<p>That in itself is not a noteworthy event — life is booming here these days, and traffic slows &amp; stops all the time.</p>
<p>But this time was unusual: it was stopped because maybe 200 protesters were on the freeway, chanting “Don’t shoot”, “I can’t breathe”, “Let go” and other similar things, protesting the decision of the Grand Jury not to indict the police officer in the Eric Garner case, and coming so soon after a painfully similar decision in Ferguson.</p>
<p>Traffic was stopped for 10 minutes or more — people got ticked off and honked. We just watched and listened. For the record: I wasn’t unhappy at all to be stuck; I was just trying to watch and understand. And I think, for whatever it’s worth, that the protesters have a point: our system is not working.</p>
<p>It’s a little surprising to me that this happened on 101, but not all that surprising — weird things happen all the time in Silicon Valley, and Palo Alto is a university town, after all.</p>
<p>But here’s what did surprise me: I felt not at all comforted by the arrival of the 8–10 police cars that came. I saw the officers get out of marked &amp; unmarked cars with batons drawn. Putting on bulletproof vests. Holstering their guns at the ready. I felt, viscerally, for one of the first times in my life, that I didn’t really think that these officers were on the same side as we were. I didn’t feel that they understood the situation and how to appropriately respond.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the record, I never felt unsafe. Or even really inconvenienced. And I don’t think the Palo Alto police acted in any inappropriate ways at all.</p>
<p>But when you see a couple of dozen cops arrive, armed, to deal with an obviously peaceful protest, well we as a country have obviously lost the plot. When we start arming ourselves against our own citizens <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as a routine matter, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->things are pretty goddamned broken.</p>
<p>And I felt that way as a pure bystander, with no fear at all. I can’t imagine how I would have felt if I were protesting. Or black. Or Latino.</p>
<p>For me, and for most of us driving on 101 tonight, 15 minutes lost on our way home from working.</p>
<p>But for those without voices, and for all of us over the long haul, we have to figure out how to reverse this. To get back to when peace officers really, truly took care of those who couldn’t take care of themselves.</p>
<p>We can’t keep going this direction.</p>

			 <p>We should all know how things work.</p>
<p>Background: I wrote most of this essay about 4 years ago when the iPad first came out (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->here’s the original<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, although it will seem dated), but with the rise of efforts like Codecademy and Code.org, and my own sons growing up, I’ve been thinking more and more about technical literacy and how we can help more people understand how things work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The thing that prompted me to write this piece initially was the launch of the iPad, and the conversations that it started about whether as a culture we’re headed towards permission-only innovation or not — my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ben wrote a piece about how he felt about it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and more broadly how he felt about the restrictions that Apple was putting on how people could build things for it. He felt a lot of the same things then that I felt, although I didn’t agree with all of them.</p>
<p>But since that launch several years ago, many things have changed.</p>
<p>Apple has opened up (slowly, carefully, probably not as much as they could or should, but nevertheless moving in a better direction). Kickstarter &amp; Indiegogo became enablers for a huge generation of hardware hacking &amp; helped products like the Oculus get into the world. Incubators like Highway 1 emerged. And the Maker movement got stronger &amp; stronger. It’s been an incredible renaissance, and I’m encouraged by it.</p>
<p>For me, the essential point was — and remains — that we (Americans, netizens, techies, almost any grouping that I can think of that’s meaningful) are at our best when we are makers, when we tinker, when we invent. We’re at our best when we’re taking things apart — whether it’s technology, laws, organizations — twisting them around to see how they work, tweaking them this way and that, and eventually creating something new.</p>
<p>Invention and entrepreneurship is at the heart of change and progress; hacking and tinkering is the thing that leads to that invention.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, what (still) worries me about the trajectory of computing is not so much the emergence of tightly-controlled, non-tinkerable boxes, but the presumption that “normal people” don’t ever want to tinker, don’t want to be bothered with understanding how things work. I think it’s not true, really — certainly not for everyone — but I even think that this distinction between “normal people” and “tinkerers” or “techies” or “makers” is bogus at best, and really dangerously corrosive at worst.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of a story about my own background and evolution as an engineer, and how that happened at all.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, I remember my dad futzing around with everything. I remember him having a workshop in each of the houses we lived in (we moved around every few years as the Air Force stationed him in different places). I remember him working on our cars, our plumbing, and on our electrical systems in every house, on appliances, everything. I remember we seem to have built a deck for every house we ever lived in. He was just constantly working on building &amp; taking apart &amp; understanding &amp; rebuilding. Not to mention repairing a bunch of things that his knucklehead sons broke from time to time.</p>
<p>But I have this especially strong memory that until I was probably 10 or 11, every television we bought would come in a kit, as a box full of parts, that Dad would put together — it was always a project for him. Now, as a kid, having a Heathkit television was basically mortifying. I mean, I just wanted us to go buy a “normal” television at Sears like everyone else did. Our TV didn’t look like other folks, and being different as a kid is always a tough feeling.</p>
<p>And, in fact, our first computer was a Sinclair Z-80 that, you guessed it, came in a kit. Then, since there was no prepackaged software to run on it, I typed in a bunch of BASIC programs from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BYTE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> magazine. Good times.</p>
<p>The benefits of having that awkward feeling as a kid, though, have been profound and long-lasting. The upside is that I’ve never really viewed technology as something that was magic. It always had components that added up to the whole, that you could replace, that you could mix in different ways. I’ve always felt like technology (and organizations, and laws, and most everything else) comes to us in a way that we should be poking at it, thinking about how things work, wondering how to make things better, wondering what would happen if you removed certain things.</p>
<p>I think people will say to me: “Well, of course. You’re (at least trained as!) an engineer; you’re a tinkerer. That’s what engineers do — normal people don’t assume they can rewire their house, or swap out a power supply on their TV or change the way an operating system works.”</p>
<p>But I think that’s bogus. It’s not like I was born an engineer — the instinct to fiddle with things isn’t something we’re born with. I became a tinkerer because I was exposed to surfaces that allowed — that invited — it. I figured out that I liked tweaking and building and creating because I got a bunch of chances to do that stuff, from hardware to software and everything in between. I knew I could do it because Dad modeled that behavior, but also because the stuff we had around the house was inspectable and malleable.</p>
<p>Don’t misunderstand: I don’t think it’s a real problem that I can’t change the capacitors in my television today — I think that the most interesting surfaces for tinkering tend to evolve over time — and today the primary tinkering substrates appear to me to be the web, mobile interfaces, and, happily, hardware itself.</p>
<p>But what I worry the most about is a cultural problem: the idea that there’s a split between the people who make the things in our world and the people who don’t — the ones who just consume/use/buy them. Go to any cafe in San Francisco or Palo Alto or New York, and it’s full of builders and makers. What an incredible development &amp; evolution.</p>
<p>And I’m still worried that because of the ubiquity of the makers here (“here” meaning the broader technology community, not just SF &amp; Palo Alto), we can’t see the split that’s growing between makers &amp; non-makers, between the insiders &amp; the outsiders.</p>
<p>The thing that I’m worried about is this feeling that seems to be growing in technology communities that “normal people” — these non-tinkerers — don’t want to tweak things, shouldn’t be allowed to tweak things, can’t be trusted with technical matters. Many will choose not to, I completely agree. But we shouldn’t presume such.</p>
<p>When people talk about coding literacy or technical literacy, what I hear &amp; think is not necessarily that everyone will code in the future, but that we want more people exposed to understanding a bit about how things work, and see paths for themselves that are natural &amp; inclusive, as opposed to alien and forbidding.</p>
<p>We all have the potential inside us to make things. But we’re not born into the world as makers — the world around us — the people in it and the artifacts in it — help us to discover what we can be.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Blow Against the Empire<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In 2004, it looked like Microsoft would own browsing forever. Then came a feisty open-source browser called Firefox. And the web was never the same.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ten years ago last week Firefox officially launched into the world. The browser was already a big deal, though, even before it hit 1.0. In true open source and Mozilla fashion, Firefox’s developers had been steadily sharing the code and product so that everyone could use it and contribute to its development. On release, millions of people around the world were quick to adopt it, because it put the user back in control of the web.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yet just a couple of years earlier, in 2002 and 2003, hardly anyone thought of Mozilla at all. I’ll admit that I wasn’t immune. At the time I was working on my own Silicon Valley startup, and the Mozilla project seemed wholly irrelevant to my present or future. Little did I know that a few years later, not only would I come to care greatly about Mozilla’s work, I would become CEO of the organization.</p>
<p>Prior to Firefox’s launch, though, Mozilla was mostly seen as an afterthought or, perhaps, some kind of crazy nonprofit group. This small group of open source hackers, known as Mozillians, were working on projects that virtually nobody thought they needed. The public certainly didn’t think it wanted a new browser. People were using Internet Explorer (IE), which Microsoft had bundled with Windows. In 2004, IE had approximately 95% of the web browser market.</p>
<p>I’m going to repeat that, because the number is ridiculously high: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->95 percent<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>WTF? What was going on?</p>
<p>It was so obvious at that point that Internet Explorer had thoroughly colonized the web — MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!! — that Microsoft virtually disbanded the group, sending many of its members off to work on Silverlight, the company’s nascent web development tool. (A younger, less mature Me, would put a snarky comment here. Today’s Me, a clearly more sophisticated and subtle individual, will leave that as an exercise to you, Dear Reader.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Web technology was complete; Microsoft had finished it. Innovation really, really slowed down.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And I say, without exaggeration, that the web sort of sucked in 2003. You’d be using it during the day at work, and as you packed up to go home at the end of the day you’d go through and close the dozens, or hundreds, of popups that littered your screen.</p>
<p>Other browsers gained toeholds during this time, so it wasn’t 100% obliteration—Opera fought the good fight, for example—but let’s be honest: these other efforts were on the margins.</p>
<p>But then: Firefox.</p>
<p>Firefox came not as an obvious breakthrough, even within the Mozilla project itself. Mozilla’s prior products had been an integrated suite of e-mail, web and authoring tools . Even Mozillians disagreed on whether you could take just the browser client, make it fast and remove all the crap, put the user in control with tabs and popup blocking, and make a go of it.</p>
<p>But that’s just what the Firefox team did. In the first month of its release, millions of people found Firefox and started using it. From the vantage point of 2014, it’s easy to be a little blasé about a few million users, but in 2004 (and even by today’s standards, really), the browser had a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lightning fast start.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>With Firefox climbing to a few percentage points of market share—and with Firebug, an add-on for web developers, making it easier for innovators to build new types of web apps—the web was suddenly alive again. Vibrant.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What had been so obvious just months before, that the web was moribund, was now just as obviously hogwash. Yesterday’s wisdom had become today’s foolishness.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The group that yesterday had been viewed as quixotic for attacking the 95% market share of Internet Explorer was suddenly lauded for having worked on the right problems, for the right reasons, even as the market told them those issues didn’t matter at all.</p>
<p>And thank god for their persistence &amp; stubbornness: they opened the web back up.</p>
<p>Mozilla opened up the web in ways that are hard to even grok from our smartphone-dominated perch of 2014. But having a mass market alternative to IE let people break away from Microsoft leadership and developer dominance (Firefox would eventually be used by nearly half a billion people). Having a developer-oriented browser meant that an interesting new class of Web 2.0 applications could be delivered via the web, including things such as Delicio.us and StumbleUpon, but more fundamentally apps such as Gmail and Pandora. The Firefox success story was also an object lesson in how a small band of techies could take on giants such as Microsoft, which were thousands of times their size.</p>
<p>I myself would get involved about 6 months later —in 2005 I had just left my own startup. I wanted to start a career in investing, so I was talking with a number of venture firms on Sand Hill Road. But I just couldn’t escape the gravitational pull of working on something that was obviously so right, and something that mattered so much. Joining a tiny nonprofit organization was a surprising detour for me, but it may have been the smartest decision of my career. It changed everything about the way I think about products and organizations, and helped me prioritize working on things that really, really mattered.</p>
<p>It’s easy to look back on the last decade and think that things were destined to happen just the way they did. It’s tempting to assume that no matter what, the web would have been vibrant through the 2000s, and that the dual forces of iOS and Android would have emerged to lead us into the period of innovation we are in today. But it’s just not true.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The work by the group of Mozillians that led to the release of Firefox 10 years ago changed so much, for so many. And it reopened the frontiers of the web.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So when I see the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->announcements that Mozilla is making this week<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I’m hopeful, even though I’m not involved anymore. And I’m grateful that so many people are still focused on helping normal humans get involved with the creation of the technology we use; allowing them to assert control over their privacy and their content; and helping our technology become more robust and diverse as a result.</p>
<p>It’s easy to dismiss Mozilla today — because they’re off at it again, tilting at the impossible windmills of mobile and privacy and putting users in control of their technology. The battle is done. Mozilla’s impact is in the past.</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t count them out. I made that mistake 10 years ago, and it’s clear to me today that we need a voice like Mozilla’s. I’m optimistic that it will continue to find ways to do what everyone else “knows” is not achievable.</p>
<p>Happy birthday, Firefox. And congratulations to everyone who played a part in Mozilla’s history. There’s much to be proud of, and many impossible missions ahead. Onward.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes 140 characters isn’t quite enough to have a nuanced back &amp; forth.</p>
<p>A few minutes ago I tweeted that the more I think about it, the more I think that Microsoft buying Minecraft is an incredible, incredible (and surprising) move by Satya Nadella that is very very long range in thinking.</p>
<p>I got some pushback in my Twitter stream that says Microsoft doesn’t need another game franchise, has a strong Xbox line, etc etc.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: Minecraft is less like Halo, and a lot more like Lego. It’s not a game, any more than Lego is just a toy. It’s cultural, and foundational.</p>
<p>When I talk with just about any techie maker that I know today, then can remember back to when they first started playing around with how things work, with how to make <!-- raw HTML omitted -->their own new things. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->People in my generation can remember, vividly, when they started playing D&amp;D and how they built those worlds. How they set up their little Lego guys in all sorts of scenarios. And what computer they typed (copied, generally) their first program into. The generation after mine remembers that, but built on the web &amp; Netscape. The newest generation can tell you about their first mobile app building experience.</p>
<p>So here’s the thing: the next generation of makers — 5 or 10 years down the road — they’re all building worlds in Minecraft today. Just look around. Watch what the most interesting kids around are getting obsessed about. Take a look at what they’re building, and the levels of complexity they’re grappling with before they even really can grok what they’re making.</p>
<p>They’re next.</p>
<p>And Microsoft buying Minecraft — and, hopefully, investing in Minecraft in a way that also lets it stay independent and vibrant — says, very clearly, that Microsoft wants to stand, again, with the makers.</p>
<p>Lots of reasons to be skeptical, cynical, pessimistic, or whatever. And anyone who knows me or my background knows that I’ve been very skeptical of, if not combative with, Microsoft through most of my career.</p>
<p>But with this move, Microsoft is saying they are with the makers — the next generation — and that’s a smart, wondrous, and optimistic start to Satya’s leadership there, seems to me.</p>

			 <p>Take a look at this quote, from my very good friend &amp; mentor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mitch Kapor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the kicker: he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote this in 1991<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, nearly 25 years ago.</p>
<p>He wrote it as part of an essay for a nerd magazine that only a few of you will remember called Dr. Dobb’s Journal —<!-- raw HTML omitted --> here’s the whole essay<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as repurposed for Terry Winograd’s book <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bringing Design to Software.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I can’t overstate how much Mitch’s essay changed my life. I was an undergrad at Stanford, mostly focused on computer architectures and how to make more &amp; more electrons do things for us faster &amp; faster.</p>
<p>But then I read this and everything changed. I stopped caring so much about the things we were making, and started caring a lot more about the things that we wanted to do with them, or really more broadly, with, in &amp; around them.</p>
<p>Mitch had, in 1991 — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->before the advent of the web &amp; the browser<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — three profound insights.</p>
<p>First, along the lines of McLuhan and many others before him, it was clear to him, even in a pre-Netscape world, that technology wasn’t just riding alongside of or on top of culture, but was becoming mainstream culture. Even today I’m not sure everyone internalizes that, although it’s becoming harder and harder not to see.</p>
<p>Second, he articulated that like buildings need architects — for taking into account the human needs of a building, rather than purely engineering concerns—software would also need them, not just in the sense of technical architects, but really in the sense of design thinkers. On a personal note, once I read that, and thought about it, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. For me, it just changed everything in my perspective.</p>
<p>But mostly, and crucially, he pointed out that our software and systems were mostly not delivering on the promise. (It’s an aside, but for those of you who are interested in the real origins of the movement towards personal empowerment from personal computers, I highly recommend John Markoff’s <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What the Dormouse Said<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)</p>
<p>So I think about this evolution a lot. And as I write today, it’s so clear that we’ve made so much progress since Mitch wrote this in 1991. People (generally) know what design can do and how important it can be (although we have a long way to go on this front, still.) Individuals are so empowered from their phones and tablets, wherever they are, all the time: from a cafe or from Ferguson, from a tiny startup crammed into a loft to while you’re walking down the street. We’ve delivered on so much of the promise.</p>
<p>And yet: when we get a little outside of our Silicon Valley/SF/NYC/Berlin/etc bubble, it’s just so obvious that there’s so much left to do, so much coming.</p>
<p>Along these lines, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->love <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kevin Kelly’s essay <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You Are Not Late<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Go read it.</p>
<p>We have entered a time of permanent, frenetic, technology-led but human-centered revolution. There’s never, ever been a better time to go make the world you want.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about where I live online. I don’t really mean where I hang out — Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr — I mean where &amp; how I express myself in all my various aspects. (And obviously, by extension, how we all do.)</p>
<p>That probably needs a little explaining, so some background:</p>
<p>I started blogging about 10 years ago, on Typepad. That was an interesting time for me personally — I was just leaving my own startup, Reactivity, I was exploring a ton of interesting things online, playing a lot of World of Warcraft, starting to get interested in Firefox &amp; Mozilla, which I would join a few months later.</p>
<p>And then I saw Joi Ito’s blog — it was sort of a revelation to me. It was a collection of his writing, of course, but also had the music he was listening to from last.fm, where in the world he was from Dopplr, his WoW info in some detail, and the conversations he was enabling via comments. It was amazing to me — because in a lot of ways it represented Joi’s online persona. But it was a little difficult then to piece together all of that in a way that looked good, and reflected a real personality. He had it custom built. And I hacked together my own, with a little help, on top of Wordpress — that’s what eventually evolved into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->john.jubjubs.net<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is nominally alive, but not very active. (And I’m considering mothballing it now.)</p>
<p>As I got more interested in Twitter and more involved with Tumblr, plus Instagram, I moved most of my activity over to those platforms. Connecting publishing to audience was a revelation, and the reblogging/retweeting semantics provided interesting amplifications that just weren’t really possible previously. Not to mention the quick hits of each of these — so quick to post a quote, or an image, or a picture of where I was, or to reblog someone else’s great content.</p>
<p>And now I tend to write on Tumblr, Medium, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc etc, and to post photos primarily on Instagram and push them to Tumblr, Twitter &amp; Facebook, depending on the subject &amp; the context.</p>
<p>But I don’t feel like I have much of a home anywhere anymore. I feel spread out on the web, diffuse. Tumblr for some things, but not a lot of them. Medium for others, but not really for posting pictures from a Stanford baseball game.</p>
<p>And then when you think about native expression on mobile &amp; tablet, not much help. You’ve got things like Storehouse &amp; Steller, for better native storytelling, but they don’t really scratch the itch. Maybe about.me?</p>
<p>This feels like an extremely important thing to me. For better or worse (I would argue mostly better), we’re living more &amp; more of our lives online — feels like we need a new, modern, accessible place to call home that’s natural both on the web and native.</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Benedict Evans has a tremendously good analysis of Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp<!-- raw HTML omitted --> up that’s highly worth reading.</p>
<p>It’s a wonderful analysis of Facebook’s motivations, but in my mind, here’s the most relevant idea for thinking about the future:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pagerank/Backrub<!-- raw HTML omitted --> showed up in 1996 in technology as a way to make sense of the chaos of the web and what it was becoming. The web seemed very large to folks then, but as we know now, it was really a tiny, tiny fraction of what it would become.</p>
<p>Google incorporated 2 years later in late 1998. It would take several more years for search to become the ubiquitous and dominant way for most people to interact with the web, and then a few more after that for Google to win. It’s hard to remember now, but it was a bit of a breakthrough in 2004 when Firefox &amp; Opera built search into the browser at a mostly equal footing with direct URL navigation. That’s only 10 years ago, and nearly 8 years after Larry &amp; Sergey started thinking about how to get real ranking signal from the noise that was the web.</p>
<p>And mobile today, and the promise of what is yet to come, is so much more massive than what we saw with the web. So many more people. Connected more often. To more of their friends. And more of the things in the world connecting too. Orders of magnitude bigger.</p>
<p>But it’s also more fragmented, more siloed. Backrub was possible because links were open &amp; inspectable, and the web was crawlable by anyone.</p>
<p>That isn’t really the case for mobile yet. Much of the content &amp; services &amp; connections is all locked up by the big, sophisticated players. So data is more fragmented, more separate. And less mash-uppable. So we got apps, and daily/hourly engagement with billions of people. But we haven’t figured out how to sort it yet. Haven’t figured out how to find &amp; share.</p>
<p>That’s why network platforms like this are so critical, and so important for the future.</p>
<p>Mobile &amp; connected is so much bigger than the PC web ever was.</p>
<p>We are in a pre-pagerank phase of mobile.</p>
<p>Such a profound statement, and so, so, so much opportunity implicit in that very short sentence.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My partner Reid has a fun metaphor he uses when he’s describing how companies think about their core strategies (which don’t change very much). He says that he thinks about a company’s strategy as a cup of water they’re holding, trying to keep as much water in the cup as possible at all times (and sometimes increasing it), while navigating the landscape around them. Trying not to lose a drop.</p>
<p>Competitors, partners, and other companies are doing the same thing, tending to their own cups of water, navigating their own landscape. Sometimes near where you are, sometimes not in the same zip code.</p>
<p>And added to this, every once in a while as you pass by a competitor, you might want to give a nudge, or a hard push — to make them lose a little of the water in their cup.</p>
<p>So overall you’ve got 3 types of actors here: companies protecting their cups of water; companies trying to knock other companies’ cups of water over; and the landscape that everyone’s navigating.</p>
<p>I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->love <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this metaphor, and it’s useful to think about in all sorts of ways.</p>
<p>This week I got to spend some time with Benedict Evans and Ben Bajarin, courtesy of Semil Shah, two <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extremely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sharp, thoughtful &amp; knowledgable analysts of what’s happening today with computing, and that was followed up by Apple’s marketing event the next day, where Apple notably reduced the pricing of OS X Mavericks, iLife and iWork to effectively zero.</p>
<p>Lots of gnashing of teeth, pontificating, blogging about it. Lots of misunderstanding, too. A few folks commented this week that Apple &amp; Google (not to mention Microsoft, Samsung &amp; Amazon) are all highly transparent in their strategies, but not everyone seems to understand them.</p>
<p>Here’s the frame that I use: Apple sells systems. Google sells services. Amazon sells content. Microsoft, in general, sells software, although that’s changing now.</p>
<p>Sometimes people call Apple a hardware company, but that’s not quite right. Others have said they’re a software company, pointing out that it’s the quality of the software experience that really sets them apart, but that’s not quite right either. Having watched Apple for nearly 30 years now, and having worked at 1 Infinite Loop, I really think they think of themselves as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->personal computing systems company <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and always have. They sell systems that work. Samsung, by contrast, sells hardware — they’re not as complete in their systems ambitions as Apple.</p>
<p>Google sells services that help you do things, find things, buy things, learn things. They pay for them, in general, not by charging the consumer but by charging the advertiser. But they sell services.</p>
<p>Amazon, naturally, sells content. Microsoft has always sold software, but they’re clearly exploring each of these models: services (Azure, Office 365, Bing), hardware (Nokia), systems (Xbox, Surface).</p>
<p>So now back to Apple and this week’s price reductions. Pretty easy to see, in your mind’s eye, Apple taking care of their systems business, their cup of water — and thinking that getting people on the most modern versions of their software <!-- raw HTML omitted -->both <!-- raw HTML omitted -->increases the quality of the systems they sell <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sort of pushes on Microsoft’s software-oriented cup of water.</p>
<p>But you can see it everywhere. In how Google pushes Android &amp; Chrome — not as systems, but as service front ends. In how Amazon sells Kindle at break-even or a loss — to make their content cup of water more stable.</p>
<p>The thing that’s most confusing is that they’re all walking around, with their different cups of water, but in the same landscape (consumer mobile), at a time when human beings’ expectations of that landscape are changing very quickly.</p>
<p>Exciting times.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I say this — “Life is Long” — a lot when I’m talking with people about careers, and jobs, and getting to work together on things. What I really mean when I say it, often, is not to worry overmuch about the small things, the small decisions.</p>
<p>Except sometimes it’s not long at all.</p>
<p>Yesterday I found out a friend of mine passed away after being sick for a while, at the age of 41. It’s hit me pretty hard, and I felt nauseous most of yesterday and again this morning thinking about his family.</p>
<p>It’s a great example of the tension between life feeling long and short. I’ve known him since high school — I think we met in 1987! — when we were both doing Latin contests (nerds!) in Texas. Then we both got to Stanford as frosh in 1989 and hung out together, since we didn’t really know anyone else — and went from knowing each other a little to becoming friends as we figured this new place out. Over the years since, we’ve interacted a few times a year. For a while he worked in venture and helped us make some important breakthroughs at my own startup. And he worked in technology companies where our paths overlapped not infrequently.</p>
<p>And, bizarrely, we both liked the same set of sports teams: all things Stanford (natch), the Cowboys, the Braves, and the Spurs. (And the world needs a lot more Spurs fans.) So we’d connect a few times a year, complain about the Cowboys, marvel at the Spurs and Stanford, and talk about work, our families, and increasingly our kids.</p>
<p>Our work would intersect from time to time over the 20 years since Stanford, and we could always just pick up in whatever new context we were in.</p>
<p>So I’ve been thinking a lot over the last day since I found out about the nature of friendship, and how special it is to have an easy, comfortable friendship and working relationship with someone over the space of decades. It’s hard for me to really think that we won’t see each other on something or other, and talk about sports, and kids, and life, again this year. And next, and next.</p>
<p>I don’t really know quite how to finish this post. No pithy saying, no big lessons. But I miss my friend already, and worry about his family. And I feel very lucky to have known him over these 25 years we we’ve become who we are.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, Kathy &amp; I brought home our new baby boy, ZBL. He was born on Tuesday at Stanford Hospital — he and Kathy are both doing super well, and SPL is excited to be a big brother.</p>
<p>What I wanted to write about this morning is optimism. The act of bringing home a new baby is such an incredible act of optimism. It’s just impossible not to look at everything with new eyes and to see potential everywhere.</p>
<p>As I get to know Z, I find that just talking to him, telling him about all the things that he’ll learn about and interact with and make — it fills me with a spirit of possibility.</p>
<p>Raising kids is challenging, no doubt about it. And there are days which can be pretty long.</p>
<p>But we get so many things from our kids, and like it did with his big brother, it’s amazing to me how much Z coming into the world has already given me, how much it’s broadened my perspective, and how he’s already helping me see so much optimism and possibility in the world.</p>

			 <p>N.B.: this post might be in the “too much information” category for some of you. If so, just click on to the next thing.</p>
<p>I’ve been meaning to write this post for months, but haven’t been able to get it done. Partly because it’s been such a busy year, but partly too because I’m not really sure what to say.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think it’s important to write, so here goes.</p>
<p>Kathy &amp; I are expecting our second child in June — we’re so, so excited about it. We had our first child nearly 7 years ago — and he’s the sun and the moon for both of us — he’s everything, really. Despite the fact that Kathy &amp; I have known each other since high school in 1985 (no joke!) and have been married since 2000, we waited relatively late to start our family, having SPL when we were each 35. Lots of reasons for that, but I think ultimately we wanted to be “just us” as a married couple for a while, get that sorta figured out a little bit.</p>
<p>It didn’t happen right away for us — it took a couple of years of trying for it to happen. At some level, that was the first really clear indication in our lives that there are some things that you just can’t schedule, you can’t control, don’t always happen the way you draw them up.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we waited a couple of years to start thinking about our second child — and it was a considerably harder path than the first time around. We went through several surgeries, IUI cycles, and several cycles of IVF. We never really figured out exactly what the problems were, just factors that might have made things less likely.</p>
<p>We started at Stanford, and after a bunch of research and talking with friends we could find, we ended up going to a clinic in Denver. We went through a bunch of invasive &amp; emotional &amp; tiring procedures in Denver that required Kathy to be away from SPL &amp; me for a week or two at a time. My mom came out several times to help — not sure what we would have done without her.</p>
<p>And then, in the cycle that we had decided would be our last time, everything worked. That was about 7 months ago now, and our second child appears to be healthy &amp; heading towards coming into the world in June. We’ll both be 41, and SPL will be nearly 7. So we’re excited, and a little terrified, too (but in mostly a good way).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But here’s why I wanted to write this: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as we went on our own path, we would often tentatively mention a word or a phrase related to IVF and when we saw the person we were with nod or respond, then we would discuss a little more actively. We’re so grateful for our friends along the way who had gone before us — they were all incredibly supportive and helpful.</p>
<p>I figure there must be many, many more people going through this than we know. Especially here in California I think people are waiting longer and longer to have kids — so you’d expect more problems along the way.</p>
<p>But there’s a reluctance, or embarrassment, or something that keeps people from talking about it much. I hope that that goes away over time as it becomes more common and better understood.</p>
<p>That’s why I wanted to write this, ultimately — not because I have a ton to add to the conversation — I have some modest insight from our own experience, but mostly it’s been a very personal journey for Kathy &amp; me. But I hope by writing that more people will start to feel that it’s okay to talk about, to write about.</p>
<p>Like so many other areas, sunshine and knowledge are hugely powerful. We’ve been lucky to have so many friends in this along the way, and I hope others going through it do also.</p>
<p>Looking forward to June. 🙂</p>

			 <p>At TED, I’ve found there are overall themes of each conference that speakers keep coming to again &amp; again — often not the official theme, but a reflection of where the mood of the community is. And then I’ve found that wherever I am personally, I get coherence in different ways. For me this year, and for many of the folks I’ve talked with, the theme is intentionality: how to figure out and live a life that you want to live, instead of taking the one that comes to you.</p>
<p>As a friend said last night, it feels like there were maybe a half dozen talks about just this thing. From Sherry Turkle’s worry about how devices are making us alone, together; to Jen Pahlka’s excellent thoughts on becoming better and more involved citizens; to David Kelly’s thoughts on creative confidence and how to nurture it; and to Bryan Stevenson’s unbelievable talk about how he’s made a difference, and the people in his life who have helped him “keep his eyes on the prize.”</p>
<p>I’m coming to view intentionality, depth of thought and connection, and the power to focus as the central developmental challenges of our society today. We’re going through an incredibly rapid transformation into an always connected, real-time, perma-entertained, ever stimulated world — and it’s becoming clear to me that, somewhat ironically, it’s the people who can take advantage of all of that, while also ultimately staying within themselves, will be the ones who make the most profound and positive changes in our world.</p>
<p>So that applies to all of us, and implies much about how to think about living our lives, interacting with each other, and teaching our children.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot over the last few months — or really probably the last year or so — about how to be more intentional in my life — i think this week has catalyzed some of my thinking, so I’ll plan to write about a bunch of different aspects of it as I work through my own re-intentioning of my life.</p>

			 <p>A close friend of mine likes to joke about how entrepreneurs &amp; operators who become venture capitalists are “trading in their blue light sabers for red ones” – it’s a funny analogy…naturally, comparing investors to Sith Lords seems to fit pretty well some days.</p>
<p>But the benefit of switching from one side to the other is that perspective can sometimes be illuminated. After nearly 20 years of operating at places like Mozilla, Reactivity, Trilogy &amp; Apple, I still tend to think like an entrepreneur myself, so some of the assumptions of life inside a VC are maybe a little more obvious to me than folks who have been around longer.</p>
<p>So here are some observations about my first year of VC life, and then some of the ways that being on the “inside” has changed the way I think that entrepreneurs should think about approaching investors – things I wish I had understood myself when I was pitching.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Year of Observations about VC Life <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life as a VC is a sea of meetings.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Really, it is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of meetings. Most of them are single meetings, with no follow-ups. Most don’t result in an investment in a company at all. In 2011 I had first meetings with just over 350 companies, plus another 100 more as parts of business plan judging and demo days. Those meetings resulted in just four investments for me (Tumblr, Dropbox, Clearslide and Citrus Lane) plus a handful of seed investments.</p>
<p>That’s a massive “bias-to-no” for any profession – 99% or so. It’s a tough negative bias, and every investor I know is affected by it in some way. But that one percent is like a lightning strike: those meetings can form the basis for some of the most interesting and meaningful work you’ll ever do.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->High fidelity communication is impossible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because so many meetings are one-offs like I described, it’s very hard to communicate effectively. As an operator, you get good at being direct with the people you work with – or you fail.</p>
<p>In the context of a startup, relationships are developed over a period of months or years, so that candor can be better understood and more nuanced, resulting in communications that are efficient and effective, without hurt feelings from misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Venture meetings aren’t like that. They’re incredibly overloaded: you’re trying to have a really good communication about who you are, what you’ve built, and how you want to grow. And you’re trying to do it in what is very often an extremely emotionally significant context of someone putting everything at risk to change the world. All with no existing relationship context to fall back on.</p>
<p>As an investor, I feel that a situation like that deserves my fullest possible attention, and my best questions about and suggestions for the business. But since we’ve never interacted before, there’s the danger of seeming too harsh in cases like that – we don’t have the shared context, vocabulary and trust frameworks in place that you do in longer term relationships. I think that’s why so many investors are often vague or non-responsive in their interactions afterwards – something I’ve tried very hard to avoid, although with imperfect success so far.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Timing is everything, and everyone is multi-tasking. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This applies to both the startup and the investor I’ve found – because each has their own set of work going, and any number of competing projects and priorities. The right thing coming by at the wrong time can be as challenging as an investment that just isn’t a natural fit. Life as a VC has different patterns and rhythms than life for operators – the nature of VC work is that you’ve got multiple companies and entrepreneurs you’re working with all the time, plus a constant stream of new folks to meet, and often in wildly different domains.</p>
<p>This means constant context switching, and there are times when excellent entrepreneurs and startups come through when it’s just hard or impossible to take focus from existing or in process investments. That creates a severe asymmetry: as an entrepreneur, you’re thinking about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thing (broadly defined as your startup), deeply,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->all the time, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->while investors that you’re talking with are trying to juggle many at once.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Venture firms and partners are idiosyncratic and highly personal.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I raised money for my own startup, I didn’t know much about how to think about approaching VCs. I knew folks at various firms, and mostly went to talk with those who I knew and then went through their process over the subsequent several weeks. I figured that VCs were all mostly similar to each other.</p>
<p>I’ll say candidly that in my case, I was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extremely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lucky when that “strategy” worked – my investors were Mitch Kapor and Peter Fenton when they were both at Accel Partners – they were incredibly great for us, and I’ve had fantastically productive relationships with both for more than a decade now. But at some level it was really just dumb luck. I could easily have found a firm and partners who wouldn’t have worked.</p>
<p>Every firm has different culture: some are collaborative, others more solo practices; a small few (including Greylock) consist of former or current entrepreneurs, other firms consist of people who have been investors most of their careers; some are progressive, some are conservative. And even in partnerships, everyone there is different. Different in interests, skills, capabilities, stage in life, and temperament, at the very least.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> meeting with an amazing entrepreneur can change your whole year. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That’s why you do it. To find people to change the world with. I’ve been very lucky this year to work with some incredible entrepreneurs and teams, not just limited to the companies we were able to invest in. And that’s what we’re all looking for: not just the opportunity to make great investments, but the chance to work with people who are setting out to make the world the way they want it. There’s no more optimistic and hopeful endeavor, and it’s 100% addictive.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Suggestions on Interacting with VCs<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Given that context on what it’s like to be on the inside of a VC firm, here are some things I wish I had understood when I pitched myself.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Timing is everything, and everyone is multi-tasking. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This applies to both the startup and the investor I’ve found – because each has their own set of work going, and any number of competing projects and priorities. The right thing coming by at the wrong time can be as challenging as an investment that just isn’t a natural fit. Life as a VC has different patterns and rhythms than life for operators – the nature of VC work is that you’ve got multiple companies and entrepreneurs you’re working with all the time, plus a constant stream of new folks to meet, and often in wildly different domains.</p>
<p>This means constant context switching, and there are times when excellent entrepreneurs and startups come through when it’s just hard or impossible to take focus from existing or in process investments. That creates a severe asymmetry: as an entrepreneur, you’re thinking about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thing (broadly defined as your startup), deeply,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->all the time, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->while investors that you’re talking with are trying to juggle many at once.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Venture firms and partners are idiosyncratic and highly personal.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I raised money for my own startup, I didn’t know much about how to think about approaching VCs. I knew folks at various firms, and mostly went to talk with those who I knew and then went through their process over the subsequent several weeks. I figured that VCs were all mostly similar to each other.</p>
<p>I’ll say candidly that in my case, I was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extremely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lucky when that “strategy” worked – my investors were Mitch Kapor and Peter Fenton when they were both at Accel Partners – they were incredibly great for us, and I’ve had fantastically productive relationships with both for more than a decade now. But at some level it was really just dumb luck. I could easily have found a firm and partners who wouldn’t have worked.</p>
<p>Every firm has different culture: some are collaborative, others more solo practices; a small few (including Greylock) consist of former or current entrepreneurs, other firms consist of people who have been investors most of their careers; some are progressive, some are conservative. And even in partnerships, everyone there is different. Different in interests, skills, capabilities, stage in life, and temperament, at the very least.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> meeting with an amazing entrepreneur can change your whole year. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That’s why you do it. To find people to change the world with. I’ve been very lucky this year to work with some incredible entrepreneurs and teams, not just limited to the companies we were able to invest in. And that’s what we’re all looking for: not just the opportunity to make great investments, but the chance to work with people who are setting out to make the world the way they want it. There’s no more optimistic and hopeful endeavor, and it’s 100% addictive.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Suggestions on Interacting with VCs<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Given that context on what it’s like to be on the inside of a VC firm, here are some things I wish I had understood when I pitched myself.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Be human; be yourself.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Be prepared and have a pitch, but be willing to go off script. Talk about the parts of what you’re doing that are the most exciting to you! And in general, it’s probably best not to just jump into a PowerPoint deck. Take a few minutes to introduce yourself, and hear a bit from who you’re seeing. Don’t get too informal, of course – you’re still in a business context – but try to interact in as authentic a working style as you can.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seek out investors who lean forward<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who engage, who ask you tough questions. Tough questions aren’t always fun, but they’re ultimately what makes your company better.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You should ask questions, too, particularly to understand how the investor thinks about businesses like yours.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I personally love getting questions and like a spirited debate. Helps us get to know each other.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Be resilient. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A “no” from a few partners or firms doesn’t mean you won’t get funded. As mentioned above, a lot of times it’s context.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Be persistent.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> A “no” on this round doesn’t mean that an investor won’t be better, or more able to work on your company in the next round.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember that relationships are progressions.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Don’t read too much into any particular interaction. Some investors ask a bunch of questions in first meetings. Some listen more and engage more as the process goes on. Everyone is different. When in doubt about what they’re thinking, ask!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Above all, don’t think of fundraising as a transaction to get finished and move onto the next thing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It is important to get the funding you need, but you’ll live with your investor for the life of your startup (and really beyond, relationship-wise). Think about it like the balancing act when you’re trying both to attract and evaluate an all-star member of your team.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary, of course. But hopefully this bit of context will make the difference for you between just a pitch meeting and the start of a world-changing new relationship.</p>

			 <p>Thanks to everyone for the thoughts on my 41st birthday yesterday! I really (&amp; sincerely) enjoyed seeing the stream of notifications on my phone throughout the day — each one a small note, but reminding me of times we’ve worked &amp; played together, all around the world, and in may different contexts.</p>
<p>As an event, 41 is not exactly a major milestone. But it was a very nice weekend &amp; birthday, and caps off a pretty significant 41st year on the planet for me. It’s a funny sort of age — not really old or young at this point.</p>
<p>Last year a lot happened — we moved to Palo Alto, SPL started kindergarten, I started at Greylock (and as an investor, a very new discipline compared to the operating that I’ve done over the last 15 or 20 years), and a bunch of other stuff, big and small.</p>
<p>As I turn 41, I feel both old and young — somewhere in between, I suppose. But I’m looking forward to my 2nd year of investing at Greylock with partners I really, really enjoy and learn from every day. I’m looking forward to continuing to see SPL grow and develop every day, week, month. I’m looking forward to Kathy &amp; my 12th year of marriage (and 27th year of being friends!) I’m looking forward to getting involved with more amazing entrepreneurs and companies of all stripes (commercial, non-profit, civic, and more). And to my extended family continuing to be amazing.</p>
<p>And then a huge thing, as Kathy &amp; I are looking forward to the arrival of our 2nd child, which we’re expecting in June. It’s such a funny thing — new babies arrive in our world every second of every day — but each one that arrives in your own life is just such a massive thing that it’s a little hard to even get your head around.</p>
<p>Having a January birthday always feels great to me — it resets and renews above &amp; beyond the end of the holidays and the New Year. And I find that I’m as excited about my 42nd trip around the sun as I’ve ever been. So much to do this year.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The best thing about writing for me is that it helps me figure out what I really think about things. And one of the very best things about doing it on the web is that others can collaborate, disagree, tweak, suggest, and generally help think through things even better. So after a couple of days of Friday’s SOPA post rolling around in my head, I think I have a tighter point of view now that I wanted to write down. (There were some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tweets, mails, comments &amp; posts in reaction to what I wrote. Super thoughtful &amp; useful.</p>
<p>Here are a few specific starting points, then I’ll get to my main point, which is that we (a technologically-oriented US, at least) are not well set up for the future in terms of how we evolve tech policy. Not a new thought, but I think the SOPA situation may be putting us in a worse spot.</p>
<p>But first 3 starting points and a personal observation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->SOPA+PIPA are awful bills. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No way around it. They over-reach, they circumscribe civil liberties, and they mostly will not work. They shouldn’t pass, and we should do whatever we can to keep that from happening. They’re the latest in a long line of legislation that looks like this: reducing freedoms in a misguided attempt to protect us from a different big bad. They’re so numerous in US history they hardly need listing here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Existing industries are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always <!-- raw HTML omitted -->oriented towards self-preservation. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No exception here. But there’s a funny thing that happens: the most progressive companies of today who become successful and dominant will become reactionary in the future, oriented themselves towards self-preservation. Same as it ever was. And you can see it even in the current situation — the companies who are most outspoken are the modern Internet companies: LinkedIn, Mozilla, Zynga, Google, etc etc. Mostly on the sidelines are the most progressive technology companies of the past decades, even including Apple. So this is not, fundamentally, a techie v content type of issue at all, but more of a progressive v conservative technology issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We do have existing laws and norms. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A number of folks argued that content owners just need to accept that pirated goods are a viable alternative and need to learn how to compete with them. I’m wholly unpersuaded by that point of view. Or, rather, I believe we do have existing laws that govern how we behave. It’s pretty clear (to me at least) that content businesses will need to evolve, and many interesting ones already have. But that’s something for a lawful market to decide, not for anyone to thrust onto content owners &amp; creators.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And then a personal observation: I was actually a little nervous writing about SOPA last week because of the tone of the conversation to date. I felt like it might actually provoke harsh negative reaction and somehow brand me as “SOPA-friendly” or against the web. That’s a weird thing for me to feel, as I think my web &amp; open culture <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bona fides <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are pretty well established at this point between my work with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PCF<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Code for America<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tumblr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc etc. That by itself tells me that there’s something wrong about how things are going.</p>
<p>Okay, so given all that as a context, here’s my main point: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no matter what outcome we get to with respect to SOPA+PIPA, we’re in a bad spot going forward. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I think much of the legitimate frustration on the Silicon Valley side of the fence is that there seems to be no way to have a meaningful conversation about this stuff in ways that we know to be productive. It’s happening at this point with some guy who doesn’t seem to understand technology having his staff &amp; a bunch of lobbyists prepare a non-sensical bill and then try to jam it through Congress, without any real effort to understand what might actually work. (And, worse, it’s being done in a way that seems deliberately designed to misinform.) So it’s a bunch of backroom, captured discussion that has massive impact on how we live our lives — and it’s all completely opaque (at best).</p>
<p>The real thing that I’m worrying more and more about is not SOPA <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per se, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->although that’s a very large problem itself. The real problem that I see is that our government just isn’t set up to make meaningful technology policy decisions going forward. I think Larry Lessig would argue that that’s now true about all facets of modern life, but I think that with technology it’s significantly worse. We have massive interconnectedness of systems built on an extremely rapidly changing foundation of technology. But more than that, technology is now transforming our private and public lives so quickly that we can hardly make sense of any of it at a personal level, let alone a public policy level. And there seems to be no way for legislation to keep pace unless we change the discussion there from specific technologies instead to principles of how we want to build and evolve our society.</p>
<p>And I just don’t see how that kind of conversation can happen right now.</p>
<p>I see how to defeat SOPA, more or less. But it’s more lobbying, more rhetoric, more Capitol Hill influence. And I think that all of that stuff ultimately corrupts industries that use it. I know this is not a new objection, and I’m sure that there have been people in every industry forever who have made this point.</p>
<p>So I think most of what I wanted to write on Friday is this: I desperately hope we can (1) defeat SOPA and more importantly (2) figure out a way to have useful technology policy discussions that can inform both our legistatures and law enforcement agencies. This isn’t the last law that will be technically poor and will impinge on civil liberties. There will be more, and they’ll come up more and more frequently as increasing portions of our society get disoriented by and disrupted by new technology.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t rely on symmetric (and corrupting) lobbying efforts to make things better; we’ll just get more of the same crummy situation we’ve got.</p>
<p>What I think we really need to figure out is how to help our leadership in government act and think in a more agile way, informed by more of our citizenry. More like the web, in a lot of ways. (Ed Lee’s announcement of an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SF partnership with Code for America<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a start.)</p>
<p>Maybe impossible, a pipe dream. But that’s the target I think we should be setting for ourselves, not just defeating a crappy, misinformed bill.</p>

		<a href="https://johnolilly.com/2012/01/06/whatrsquos-bothering-me-about-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-01-07 01:20:10 &#43;0700">Jan 7, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There are 3 things that have really been bothering me about how the SOPA/PIPA discussion has been going so far.</p>
<p>it’s not a discussion at all — it’s people calling each other names.</p>
<p>it’s highly likely to have a result that is unhelpful at best, and insanely destructive at worst</p>
<p>we’re building a completely worthless/bad roadmap for how to deal with technology policy going forward, and it’s going to get worse</p>
<p>Let me be very clear: SOPA is a terrible law that should not be enacted under any circumstances. It’s broken technically and misguided from a policy point of view. It not only won’t accomplish what advocates want it to accomplish, but it also will create backbreaking burdens and barriers to entry for some of our most promising technology companies and cultural movements of the coming decade.</p>
<p>But also: content creators &amp; owners have a legitimate beef with how their content can be appropriated and distributed so easily by rogue actors.</p>
<p>Here’s the conversation we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should <!-- raw HTML omitted -->be having: content &amp; technology should be very aligned. Hollywood and Silicon Valley (broadly speaking — I’m talking metaphorically here) both want the same things ultimately: easier and bigger ways to share and enjoy awesome content from all sources, in a way that’s economic for everyone involved.</p>
<p>What we should be talking about is how to get better alignment, how to build systems and content that is better for, you know, actual human beings to use and enjoy.</p>
<p>But that isn’t the conversation that’s happening (and I use the term “conversation” here very loosely, since it has characteristics more like a bunch of schoolyard name calling). The conversation that’s happening is going more like this:</p>
<p>– content: “you people are stealing our stuff. you’re thieves”</p>
<p>– techies: “we’re not stealing it. we’re just building great apps for users.”</p>
<p>– content: “you’re ignoring the problem and helping the thieves. you’re effectively pirates, so we’re going to shut everyone down.”</p>
<p>– techies: “you’re acting like jackbooted fascists, embracing censorship and your’e going to end everything that’s good about culture today.”</p>
<p>– content: “we’re trying to protect our content — you guys are pretending like there’s no problem, then getting rich off platforms that pillage our content.”</p>
<p>– techies: “you don’t understand how the Internet works — how do you even live life in the 21st century? dinosaurs.”</p>
<p>So that’s awesome. Then you throw Congress into the mix and hilarity ensues. Because if you’re looking for folks who really do not act like they want to understand the Internet, Capitol Hill is a pretty good place to start. And then this is all devolving into a fight of pirates versus creators. Of protectors-of-democracy versus fascists. Or whatever.</p>
<p>What we need to be talking about is where the actual infringement problem is happening (I’ve heard from folks that the vast majority of the problem is on the order of a few dozen syndicates overseas). And how we need to be thinking about copyright law — in an age where copies are the natural order of things, as opposed to previously, when it was harder to make copies. And what sorts of law enforcement resources we need to bring to bear to shut down the activity of these real malicious actors overseas. (At root, I’m persuaded that the current issues are really law enforcement issues – we need to figure out how to enforce the laws that are already on the books to protect IP, not create new ones.)</p>
<p>Acting like there’s no problem isn’t the answer — there is a legitimate IP issue here. But pressuring a behind-the-times and contributions-captive legislative body to enact overly intrusive and abusable laws is even worse, both economically and civically.</p>
<p>What’s extremely discouraging to me right now is that I don’t really see how we can have a nuanced, technically-informed, respectful discussion/debate/conversation/working relationship. I’m not convinced that Congress is at all the right body to be taking up these issues, and am 100% convinced that they don’t currently have the technical wherewithal to make informed decisions, in any event.</p>
<p>So what we’re left with is one group pushing their captive legislators for new, over-reaching laws and calling technologists names. And a group reacting to that by calling names back.</p>
<p>I think the best that we can hope for in this scenario is that the current bill will grind to a halt and nothing will change. But I think that can’t be where we aim for the future.</p>
<p>Because technology policy issues are going to come up again and again and again as time goes on. (Next up, undoubtedly, is another round of privacy legislation, and I would predict the name calling will be even more intense and even less productive.)</p>
<p>We’re mediating more of our lives than ever through new technologies that we barely understand as technologists, let alone consumers or civic leaders. We need to figure out ways to have meaningful discussions, to try out policies that may or may not work at first and iterate quickly on them, like we do with products themselves.</p>
<p>I don’t have any answers here, but wanted to write down what’s been bugging me, as I think we all need to think more about what we want our lives to look like in the future.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Wearing a mustache is a tough gig. Also hilarious, although I think people may not always totally get the joke…</p>
<p>A few years back, some of the Mozilla folks started doing NSID (no shaving in December) — it was a funny thing to do, especially for all hands meetings where you’d see a bunch of guys who had never really let their facial hair grow out — and the results were definitely not always pretty. Lots of scraggly beards, a few who were essentially indistinguishable from werewolves (“there, there wolf!”), and just generally lots of randomness. Was a fun thing to do, especially as more and more of us did it.</p>
<p>Last year, I did NSID until about Christmas, then went to Goatee Week for a bit, and finally on a lark, did Mustache Day, when I actually went out in public with a mustache. Here’s what I looked like:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Or, perhaps, maybe you’re thinking what we were: surprisingly, I discovered that I look a little like Ned Flanders.</p>
<p>Unexpected. And obviously super unsettling. Although not as unsettling as this pic, where I seem to look like Mario’s brother Luigi:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And an obvious signal that I should never, ever wear a mustache again. But I’m not really one to pay attention to signals, so in the spirit of blowing right through the stop sign, this year I decided to do it again. The theme of our New Year’s Eve party happened to be Comic Con, so it really just played right into my hands, and I went as Ned Flanders.</p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<p>First, it’s really hard to keep a straight face when you’ve got a mustache and are trying to talk with someone. Partly because you can’t actually believe it yourself, and partly because every 90 seconds or so they furrow their eyebrows, squint at you, then frown/grimace/laugh out loud. Pretty tough to take it seriously.</p>
<p>Second, Ned Flanders turns out to be a little too subtle of a costume, strangely. Maybe I wasn’t yellow enough. Maybe it was because I had 8 fingers instead of 10. And, you know, maybe it’s because the Simpsons was cool about 15 years ago. (It was cool then, right?) Anyway, all the people I’m close to thought it was either right on the nose or hysterical. People who I’d recently met said all night long, and I’m not joking, “I didn’t know you had a mustache!” People at the party who didn’t know me assumed, I think, I was some sort of interloper with a weird vibe.</p>
<p>Who knows.</p>
<p>But pretty strange reactions all around. I really had a good time doing it — I’m not usually a costume guy, so was fun to be someone else, even a nerd-diddly-erd, for a while.</p>
<p>So I think we’ll retire “the Flanders” for a while. Good times. 🙂</p>

			 <p>A couple of weeks ago, my second Jawbone UP failed. I’m bummed about it for a couple of reasons (and will go through the process to get a replacement for sure). The first reason I’m bummed is theoretical – I miss the data it collects, mostly because I think I’m going to want it some day, but also because it makes me a little more mindful of my activity throughout the day. The second reason is that I really, really love the vibrating alarm – it makes a huge difference in quality of life for me &amp; Kathy not to have an alarm blaring on the days I need to get up early.</p>
<p>The Lark has a vibrating alarm, but bugs me at night. The Fitbit, by contrast, I think doesn’t have the alarm, and I forget to wear it pretty often.</p>
<p>The UP solves that set of problems for me, even though it’s got other deficiencies (reliability, obviously, but also no wireless data sync, weird software UI, no open data, etc). So I’m looking forward to getting a working model again soon…</p>

<p>A lot of it felt like a Palahniuk novel to me — the earlier ones, not the more recent crummy ones (like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Damned,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which I’m about to finish and will write a very short post about.)</p>

			 <p>This is a collection of essays on the financial state of several countries – I believe most of them have been published in some form previously, but this is the first time they’ve been collected like this.

Then goes through the recent histories and situations in Greece, Ireland, Germany and the United State.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the book, like all books by Lewis. I had some trouble with the overarching generalizations about each culture – I found them to be caricatures and borderline offensive – more useful for telling an interesting story than for real help in understanding what’s going on.</p>
<p>But understanding the basics of the financial situations in each country, in a comparative way, really helped me think about what’s happening in Europe overall right now, and to think about the implications in the United States as our state and local governments run out of money. (Lewis’ analysis, or at least implication, is that sooner or later, in spite of our Federal laws and the Fed itself, that we will start to see the sort of fiduciary divergence that Europe is seeing between Northern and Southern Europe – where California is our Greece and the other, more fiscally conservative states get tired of bailing it out.)</p>
<p>I don’t totally buy that point of view, but very useful in thinking through why it’s reasonable, why things here hold the way they do, and why one path for Europe is a more united polity. Nothing is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ever <!-- raw HTML omitted -->apples-to-apples in something like this, but definitely worth reading and thinking about, and an enjoyable read like everything Lewis writes.</p>

			 <p>As I wrote up yesterday, my new Jawbone Up bracelet died on me. I was bummed, but customer service did a great job, and got me a replacement in about a day.</p>
<p>But I was surprised about the feeling I had yesterday, which is the first day I hadn’t worn the Up in about 3 weeks: I felt like I was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wasting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->data, since I didn’t have the bracelet on to collect it. Let me say that again: I felt kind of weird, because I was going to all this trouble (you know, by walking around, sleeping, etc) and none of the data I was generating was getting logged. I was just blasting it into the ether.</p>
<p>This is not totally how I expected to feel. So naturally I tweeted about it, and Chris Hogg, founder of 100plus, replied in a surprising way:</p>
<p>And when you think about it, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of course<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this is correct, but my first reaction was: “This is kind of messed up — we need to get credit for living now?” Obviously not a perfect state of being for humans.</p>
<p>But I thought about it some more on my drive in this morning, and it seems to me that a couple of different things are happening. On “getting credit,” we’re talking about taking an intrinsic motivation (living well) and replacing it with an extrinsic motivation (someone giving you credit or status). Now, that happens all the time — it’s a lot of what happens in schools, weight loss programs, sports, etc. But I think it’s not the most durable kind of behavior change mechanism.</p>
<p>And, honestly, I’m pretty sure that wasn’t what was happening with me. Because while I like to think that everyone cares about everything about me, it’s really tough to imagine that anyone reading this (except for maybe my mom – hi mom!) gives a damn about how much I walked yesterday. And it’s even tougher to imagine that I would care much about what you thought about how much I walked.</p>
<p>So for me in this particular case, I think it was my OCD nature kicking in. I didn’t really like imagining the graph (of whatever data it is that I may, some day in the future, create a graph from) having a void spot in it. I want things to be smooth lines, no drop outs. I think that can be a motivator for folks, too — completeness of the data report, but I think it’ll motivate a far smaller set of folks.</p>
<p>I think where you get to in the end is that there is something very important about tracking data, because it changes your relationship to the activities you’re measuring pretty fundamentally. (some ways good, others not good.)</p>
<p>And that collecting data about how you live, in particular, will always have holes in it — for lots of reasons.</p>
<p>Anyhow, was an interesting set of thoughts — some important things going on here.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A biography of Marshall McLuhan, one of the smartest media thinkers ever, written by Douglas Coupland, one of my very favorite authors, was going to be pretty much a no brainer for me to pick up and read and enjoy. And I really did, although I think this book probably is only for a particular type of nerd. (Pretty sure you know who you are.)</p>
<p>As you’d expect from Coupland &amp; the subject, the style of the book is sort of meta. Bits &amp; pieces about McLuhan, mixed up with other bits and pieces. I didn’t love the style, but I did find a bunch of the book thoughtful &amp; provocative. And it really is amazing how clearly McLuhan could see the future — I think he &amp; Neil Postman figured out decades ago things we’re only just now figuring out together as we all converge online.</p>
<p>Here’s what Coupland had to say to start the book:</p>
<p>Life becomes that strange experience in which you’re zooming along a freeway and suddenly realize that you haven’t paid any attention to driving for the last fifteen minutes, yet you’re still alive and didn’t crash. The voice inside your head has become a different voice. It used to be “you.” Now your voice is that of a perpetual nomad drifting along a melting landscape, living day to day, expecting everything and nothing. And this is why Marshall McLuhan is important, more so now than ever, because he saw this coming a long way off, and he saw the reasons for it. Those reasons were so new and so offbeat and came from such a wide array of sources that the man was ridiculed as a fraud or a clown or a hoax. But now that we’ve damaged time and our inner voices, we have to look at McLuhan and see what else he was saying, and maybe we’ll find out what’s coming next, because the one thing we can all agree on is that the future has never happened so quickly to so many people in such an extreme way, and we really need a voice to guide us. Marshall identified the illness and worked toward finding ways of dealing with it.</p>
<p>Amazing. But here’s the really odd bit:</p>
<p>And one must remember that Marshall arrived at these conclusions not by hanging around, say, NASA or IBM, but rather by studying arcane sixteenth-century Reformation pamphleteers, the writings of James Joyce, and Renaissance perspective drawings. He was a master of pattern recognition, the man who bangs a drum so large that it’s only beaten once every hundred years.</p>
<p>And any book like this would be incomplete without a little Canuckiana, so here’s a quote from McLuhan: “Canada is the only country in the world that knows how to live without an identity.” Interestingly, I think that while that would be considered pejorative to most in the US, I don’t think that’s how he meant it.</p>
<p>One very strange fact that floored me: McLuhan’s brain was supplied with blood through not one but two arteries at the base of his skull. In case you’re not up to date on your human physiology, that’s not normal. Sometimes happens in cats. Very rarely in humans. But you have to think that it had a real effect on how he thought and lived (and probably how he died ultimately, since he had many small strokes and blackouts throughout his lifetime).</p>
<p>Anyway, fascinating.</p>
<p>And one last thought to leave you with by McLuhan himself: “Our ‘Age of Anxiety’ is, in great part, the result of trying to do today’s job with yesterday’s tools– with yesterday’s concepts.”</p>
<p>I think we live in a complex, rapidly evolving, unfamiliar time now — so much — technology, mainly — feels like it’s changing so quickly that it’s hard to integrate all the changes in our lives, let alone to really understand them and their impact. It’s comforting to know that at least a few people felt the same way nearly 50 years ago.</p>

			 <p>I really love using Instagram — use it every week to take, process &amp; share photos, use it a lot with my wife to share what we’re up to, etc.</p>
<p>But as I was using it tonight, I realized that I’m using it in a decidedly anti-social way — which is a really stark contrast to how I live practically every other part of my online life — in general I live pretty much in the open on my blog, Tumblr, Twitter, etc etc.</p>
<p>So I thought it would be worth a quick explanation.</p>
<p>One of my working theories about mobile apps is that to get any real adoption, the app has to be on your home screen (and mostly not in a folder). People use apps on 2nd &amp; 3rd screens, but not that many, I think — I think usage of apps on the home screen probably completely dominates usage of all other apps. But there are only 20 slots on the home screen, and a bunch of those are already populated by things like your e-mail, SMS, phone, calendar, Safari, etc. So there’s a working set of maybe 4 or 5 slots for completely novel apps (for me the most important are Tweetbot, Facebook, Tumblr, Read It Later, Things &amp; Kindle). For all other apps, they’ve got to replace an app (and its functionality) that already has a spot.</p>
<p>Instagram, for me, replaced the camera app a long time ago, initially because of filters, but over time because it let me share pictures with my family and friends really easily.</p>
<p>But over the summer, I realized a pretty serious problem: my follower count was rising, and I was taking more and more pictures with Instagram — the problem was that the photos were of my family vacation, so were both pretty personal in nature, and were also like a big advertisement that our house back in the Bay Area was unattended.</p>
<p>I still wanted the sharing &amp; filters &amp; streams, though, so ended up making my stream closed, instead of open. I uninvited everyone I didn’t know and started building up the access list from scratch. Now I’ve got a relatively small, private set of followers, and it works well enough.</p>
<p>But it sort of turns the model inside out a little bit, since Instagram is really built for sharing. Instead, I’m using it more like a private repository, then sharing out pictures to other networks like Facebook, Tumblr &amp; Twitter when I want to share them broadly. But back to my apps-on-home-screen theory, the only way that Instagram can replace my Camera app is if I do it this way, making most of my photos private and only sharing a few.</p>
<p>The main problems are sort of obvious: (1) I share a bunch of things with fewer people than would actually like to share with, (2) it’s hard for me to completely replace the built-in Camera app right now, and (3) it actually just feels pretty unfriendly when I do share something on Twitter, people click through to see the shared photo and aren’t allowed to follow my stream automatically. (There’s a follow on problem in that I never look at the news feed on my account in the mobile app at all — and so I had hundreds of follower requests right now that have gone ignored for months.)</p>
<p>What I’d really like is the ability to, at minimum, have a private stream and a public stream — I think that would let Instagram completely replace the Camera app for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s why it’s closed for me, and why I may not have turned on access for you — it’s a combo of how the system works and my own neglect of the access list for a while.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been thinking a bunch about the Stanford-Oregon game yesterday — it was disappointing, because I think a bunch of us felt like this Cardinal team could really be a championship caliber team — one for the ages. But Oregon beat us badly — and showed that Stanford isn’t a championship team — at least not right now — but merely a Very Good team.</p>
<p>It’s funny, though, because college football isn’t an easy place to be “just” a very good team. And Stanford (and Silicon Valley, for that matter) isn’t an easy place to be “just” very good at what you do. Everyone wants to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the best<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not just top 5 or top 10 or great. And it’s a good instinct, and obviously productive, because looking around us at the people who inhabit Stanford and Palo Alto and the whole region, we have an awfully damn lot of people and organizations who are, in fact, the best in the world at what they do. So it’s good — really good — to strive to be the best, because if you don’t try, you sure won’t end up there.</p>
<p>But I have to say that while I’m disappointed — disappointed that we won’t have a shot to win the Pac-12 or go to the Rose Bowl or the BCS Championship — I’m really fired up about how good this team is, about how much fun it is to follow them, about how guys like Luck (but not only him) can be good at football <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all the rest of the things they value in a Stanford education.</p>
<p>We’ve had so many good — best — teams at Stanford over the last 20+ years, we get a little too used to it. But it’s been a hell of a fun weekend, and a hell of a fun season to be a Stanford fan. It was really, really fun to hike over with Kathy &amp; SPL to see Gameday filming yesterday morning. It was really, really fun to catch up with my friend Dave Garnett from across the hall freshman year. And it was really, really fun to be at the game.</p>
<p>I think it’s very important not to lose sight of just how good this team is, and how important it is to be Very Good at what we all do, even when we’re not the Best at it. And that’s an easy and important lesson I’ll share again and again with SPL as he grows up.</p>
<p>Now looking forward to Big Game &amp; Notre Dame &amp; a bowl game — should be an amazing few weeks to end the season and Luck’s time on the Farm.</p>

			 <p>Liked the latest from Neal Stephenson, but didn’t love it. As per usual, he really needed a stronger editor for the last half of the book. The book was pretty fun, and a departure for Stephenson, in that it’s not really science fiction, but something that can happen today (if a little, you know, cyber-y).</p>
<p>The first half reads a little bit like a World of Warcraft tutorial (believe it or not, that’s actually a compliment, although I know it won’t sound that way), and the last half is a bit of global chase.</p>
<p>Pretty good, very fast to read and I enjoyed it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m super, super excited to announce that I&rsquo;ve joined the board of directors of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Code for America<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an organization started by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jen Pahlka<!-- raw HTML omitted --> two years ago aimed at getting some of the smartest and most motivated techies &amp; designers among us working on solving some of the core problems facing our communities. It&rsquo;s a non-profit organization full of awesomely smart and talented and motivated folks who actually make things that can create lasting change in our cities and states and country and world. (Sound like anything else I&rsquo;ve been involved in? :-)).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a humbling organization to join, because they&rsquo;ve already made such amazing progress. They&rsquo;ve got an amazing group of CfA Fellows working with city governments this year &ndash; projects in Boston and Philadelphia and Seattle; and one with the federal government as well. They&rsquo;ve picked even more cities to work with next year in an expansion of the program. They&rsquo;ve started the Civic Commons as a way to help governments share and take advantage of code that already exists.</p>
<p>More importantly, they&rsquo;re showing how to build an organization that&rsquo;s both civically-oriented and sustainable over the long term. In my view, CfA is helping a new generation of entrepreneurs and builders to figure out how to create products and organizations that can change our relationship with our cities and towns &ndash; not every startup has to be about maximizing financial returns.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really excited to join the organization &ndash; because of what it&rsquo;s done in such a short time, because of what it represents today, and because of the promise it holds in unlocking so, so much positive and needed change in how we relate to our governments and our selves in the future.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last night, Aneel Bhusri, Jeff Weiner and I got to introduce Reid Hoffman for an award called the Innovation Catalyst Award here in Silicon Valley. We each spent about 10 minutes talking about our experiences with Reid over the years &ndash; always a fun thing to talk about, since he&rsquo;s such an interesting, smart &amp; good-hearted person. Was interesting, too, that even thought the 3 of us hadn&rsquo;t coordinated at all in preparing our talks, they all came back to the same themes of his humanity, intelligence, and great desire to help good people be better. Reid is just a very consistent guy &ndash; he brings it every day.</p>
<p>Best line of the night was Aneel&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Reid is kind of like the Kevin Bacon of Silicon Valley.&rdquo; Good stuff.</p>
<p>Here are the remarks that I prepared:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny task for me to introduce Reid to all of you since he&rsquo;s so well known. In fact, I&rsquo;d wager that not only does everyone here know all about Reid already, but you&rsquo;ve already had a lunch or a coffee with him at some point.</p>
<p>I was thinking maybe it&rsquo;d be easier if I  just grabbed the 2 of you in the room that haven&rsquo;t already met him or worked with him and give you the background one-on-one. :-)</p>
<p>His public accomplishments over the last decade are extremely well chronicled &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I need to mention the fact that he changed the world at PayPal. Or started LinkedIn, changing the way we all do work in fundamental ways. Or that he was an early angel in Flickr, Zynga, Facebook and virtually every other massively successful company that&rsquo;s come out of Silicon Valley over the last 10 years.</p>
<p>But most of that stuff is well known by everyone here, so instead tonight I&rsquo;m going to focus on the human scale, and some of the ways that Reid has powerfully and meaningfully changed my life and the lives of so many people around him &ndash; I think that might work better to give everyone a sense of how he thinks, and why it&rsquo;s so important.</p>
<p>The thread that will tie all of this together is that 2 questions dominate the way that Reid thinks and interacts.</p>
<p>The first one is this: &ldquo;How can I change the world?&rdquo; But really, every good entrepreneur asks that question all the time. Reid is unusually good at answering this particular question in a variety of different ways, but if that was the only thing he focused on, he&rsquo;d be a great entrepreneur, but something less than he&rsquo;s actually become.</p>
<p>The second question that I&rsquo;ve heard Reid ask over and over and over is very simple: &ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard him ask it in board meetings, in pitch meetings, at the airport, over drinks &ndash; everywhere you can imagine. And in my mind, it&rsquo;s the pervasiveness of that simple question &ndash; &ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo; &ndash; that sets Reid apart, and I&rsquo;ll expand a little on that now.</p>
<p>My own working relationship with Reid started off innocently enough while he was still at PayPal.  I got an e-mail from an old friend Sean White who I literally hadn&rsquo;t heard from in 10 years. The mail went something like this: &ldquo;Reid, John: I think you guys might like each other; hope you can connect; I think it&rsquo;ll be worth your time.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s maybe a measure of my cluelessness at the time, or of just how incredible a decade Reid has had since, but I didn&rsquo;t know who he was, and he seemed only semi-relevant &ndash; a finance guy! from PayPal! but I trusted my friend Sean, so gave it a try.</p>
<p>Sean was right, of course; Reid and I hit it off immediately, starting with a breakfast at Hobee&rsquo;s that would begin a strong pattern for us. He was at PayPal, I was at my own startup Reactivity then; we just got together and, predictably enough, started talking about who we knew in common. We spent a lot of time in those pre-LinkedIn days &ndash; like we still do, really, asking questions of each other like &ldquo;Have you met X? What do you think?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;do you know about company Y? Important?&rdquo; And: &ldquo;Who else do you think I should get to know?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s Reid, always, always, always building networks, always trying to put people together, see if they might fit.</p>
<p>Over time we started working on various projects together, including Mozilla, and we&rsquo;d each have lists of things to talk about going into each breakfast. The really remarkable thing about these interactions is that no matter how long we talked, no matter how much of our lists we would work through, we invariably left the meal with longer lists than we entered with &ndash; with more things to talk about, covering more shared areas of interst. And really it&rsquo;s gone on like that since &ndash; another Reid characteristic for you: he&rsquo;s always looking for more ways to help.</p>
<p>The other thing that was obvious about Reid at that point is that he always had a plan, and he pretty much did what he said he was going to do. He was really clear when the PayPal acquisition happened that he would be on to his next thing, whatever it was, soon. I figured he would take a bit of time off, catch his breath. I didn&rsquo;t know Reid well enough then, obviously &ndash; he quickly moved on, figured out that helping other people build work networks was what he wanted his attention to be on. So he got started.</p>
<p>The conversation around LinkedIn was funny &ndash; obviously LinkedIn was the ideal startup for someone who thinks in terms of people networks like Reid does &ndash; in a lot of ways it&rsquo;s the exact manifestation of his brain.</p>
<p>I was a little skeptical at the time &ndash; I told him, well, this might be good for &ldquo;B listers with B list networks.&rdquo; Obviously, folks with A list networks like mine wouldn&rsquo;t want to participate. Reid gleefully reminds me of that interaction at the most inopportune times. They seem to be doing well enough so far. :-)</p>
<p>But he was off to the races with LinkedIn, and around the same time I was trying to figure out what to do myself, having left my own startup a few months previously. And like he&rsquo;s helped so many others figure out their path, he was extrordinarily helpful with figuring out mine. In 2005 I had sort of stumbled onto an unusual organization &ndash; a non-profit, and open source project &ndash; called Mozilla &ndash; it was just15 or so employees, but they had just released Firefox a few months before, and it held great promise &ndash; it was really starting to catch on. Reid &amp; I both saw the promise right away, but as I thought about joining it, I was on the fence.</p>
<p>Typically, he thought we should discuss it more with someone he knew &ndash; in this case Joi Ito, now Director of MIT&rsquo;s Media Lab. He said &ldquo;Joi&rsquo;s going to be in town for about 90 minutes, so we need to meet him at SFO.&rdquo; I made fun of him a lot for having airport meetings &ndash; now of course, the joke is on me, since I schedule them, too.</p>
<p>So we met at SFO and had a conversation that, again, was typical of Reid &amp; Joi, and went something like this: &ldquo;do you think Mozilla is a place from which we can change the world a bunch for the better?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seems like it.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Well, seems like we should all lean in then!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s another very Reid phrase: &ldquo;lean in&rdquo; &ndash; it means we should figure out how to do something meaningful.</p>
<p>Reid likes to think about Archimedian levers &ndash; how to change the world the most with the most efficiency &ndash; and when he finds good spots to put the lever, he&rsquo;s generally all in.</p>
<p>So from that meeting, we each leaned in &ndash; Joi would eventually join the Foundation&rsquo;s board of directors, Reid would join the Corporation&rsquo;s board of directors, and I joined in an operating capacity.</p>
<p>So for me, and for Mozilla, Reid&rsquo;s orientation around finding ways to change the world, and to help others do the same, whether as entrepreneurs or social entrepreneurs or any other way &ndash; well, his point of view changed everything for us.</p>
<p>And then I got to know Reid over the next several years as a board member, which is another great privilege, although a bit of a quirky one. Reid has a tendency to be extra outfitted in terms of his information technology. He&rsquo;ll typically carry around 2 laptops and somewhere between 3 and 5 smart phones. So when he would come for a board meeting, lots of times he would bring out various of his devices and work away &ndash; enough so that you might start to think he wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. But he is. Invariably during our board meetings, we&rsquo;d be cruising along, Reid would be typing something or other then he&rsquo;d pause, look up, and say something like &ldquo;Really? That doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Wouldn&rsquo;t it really be more like this other way?&rdquo; He had a funny way of completely changing the flow of the meeting, of causing us to re-focus on the most strategic items again and again &ndash; as usual with Reid, it was him searching for the best leverage possible.</p>
<p>The funniest things were always when you talked about recruiting in a board meeting, though &ndash; every time I got back to my desk after discussing an open position at Mozilla, I&rsquo;d have between 10 and 20 LinkedIn profiles waiting in my e-mail, suggestions from Reid on who to talk with next. His output is amazing that way. Even when dealing with a million other competing priorities, he&rsquo;s as productive as anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>
<p>I talk about these very personal experiences because they&rsquo;re the ones that I know the best, but, really, you could ask just about any current entrepreneur in Silicon Valley how Reid&rsquo;s helped &ndash; he&rsquo;s always got suggestions, connections, questions, tweaks to your thinking.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s got a &ldquo;Reid story&rdquo;, everyone knows his aphorism &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not embarrassed by your first product you&rsquo;ve released too late!&rdquo; (Although now that I&rsquo;m an investor myself, I probably could stand hearing that from a few less startups who actually did release too early!)</p>
<p>Here are a few insights from folks who know Reid well:</p>
<p>Nancy Lublin, CEO of DoSomething.org (where Reid&rsquo;s a board member), said this: &ldquo;In a world where engineers have been the biggest winners over the last ten years, how did a philosopher become top shelf? It&rsquo;s kind of an awesome winning forumla: the guy loves people. It&rsquo;s not a mush, emotional thing. He&rsquo;s actually extraordinarily logical &ndash; and to him, figuring out how people can become better is like solving a puzzle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or DJ Patil, Greylock&rsquo;s Data Scientist in Residence, who previously built the LinkedIn data team tells the story about how he went to introduce himself to Reid in a parking lot at UC Santa Cruz, whereupon Reid responded &ldquo;Yes, I know who you are, we need to have lunch.&rdquo; Their first lunch after that was 3 hours long.</p>
<p>And my own most recent example &ndash; I saw a pretty early, pretty raw startup this summer for a first meeting, which went well enough. I gave them some candid feedback and made some suggestions on how they might improve their product, at the end of which they said, &ldquo;Okay, got it. But what do you think Reid Hoffman would think of our pitch?&rdquo; Hilarious. :-)</p>
<p>Overall though, here&rsquo;s the thing: I haven&rsquo;t met a single person in more than 20 years in Silicon Valley who&rsquo;s more generous with their contacts or time, who&rsquo;s more willing to listen and learn and brainstorm, or who genuinely wants everyone he meets to become as good an entrepreneur (in their work and in their own lives) as they can possibly be.</p>
<p>His fingerprints are all over today&rsquo;s business and technology landscape, and increasingly our social landscape.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got some of the flashiest credentials of anyone in the industry, but it&rsquo;s hard for me to think of a more honest, self-effacing person to meet with.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s busier than anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met, but he will always make time to meet with young entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s smarter and more knowledgable about how the consumer Internet works than just about anyone, but leaves every meeting thinking about what he&rsquo;s learned that&rsquo;s new, where his old models don&rsquo;t fit.</p>
<p>And the guy barely has time to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a book, let alone write one, but that&rsquo;s exactly what he&rsquo;s done this year. The focus? Helping everyone become an entrepreneur in their own life, naturally.</p>
<p>So in a lot of ways he&rsquo;s a bundle of competing priorities and tensions.</p>
<p>But in the ways that matter, he&rsquo;s a pretty simple guy, always asking &ldquo;How can we change the world?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How can we help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Nancy Lublin puts it, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the best example I know of good guys finishing first,&rdquo; and so I&rsquo;m very humbled to be introducing my partner and my friend Reid Hoffman tonight.</p>

			 <p>Last week in New York I got to attend a fun dinner party &ndash; about 16 folks, very diverse in terms of work, politics, interests, etc &ndash; all incredibly accomplished in their own fields. One of the things we talked about is this: &ldquo;If you could be anywhere, where would it be?&rdquo; Lots of answers &ndash; in the Alps. on a boat, on the beach, etc. When it came around to me, though, I gave a pretty boring answer: honestly, I mostly like being at home with my family, with time to spend with them.</p>
<p>This morning is perfect that way. A little autumn briskness in the air, beautiful clear day, and nothing much to do except pad around the house, take care of things that need taking care of, and be together. It&rsquo;s great to be busy (and we are busy, starting around lunchtime), but sort of magic to start the day with family and no real commitments. And nice especially because it was Kathy &amp; my 11th wedding anniversary yesterday. (And incredibly, we&rsquo;ve known each other more than 26 years now. Doesn&rsquo;t seem like there was ever a time when we didn&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got music on shuffle and on comes Simon &amp; Garfunkel &ndash; a little old school, but still amazing. &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kathy&rsquo;s Song<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; came on &ndash; one of my favorite songs of all time. And reminded me a lot of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my favorite blog post that I&rsquo;ve ever written<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, for me Halloween always marks a transition into the part of the year that&rsquo;s a headlong rush through Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year &ndash; love the season, but it&rsquo;s a bit of a sprint from here.</p>
<p>Nice to get ready for it with a quiet morning together.</p>

		<a href="https://johnolilly.com/2011/10/09/steve-jobs.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-10-09 23:22:50 &#43;0700">Oct 9, 2011</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Like many of us, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about Steve Jobs the last few days &ndash; thinking about the man and his legacy. I&rsquo;ve been having some trouble even understanding the way I feel, let alone being able to put it into words. Lots of folks have asked me what I think, and have been surprised that I haven&rsquo;t tweeted or blogged about it yet. So here&rsquo;s a first shot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding my feelings to be pretty complex, which I guess isn&rsquo;t too surprising given who he was. But for a man I&rsquo;ve never met, I&rsquo;m a little surprised about how much of my thinking he&rsquo;s affected, and how many competing feelings I&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>But some of them are pretty simple.</p>
<p>As a designer, I think it&rsquo;s impossible to feel anything but pure, unadulterated joy that Steve existed at all. And I really mean that: thank god for him, he changed so much. He wasn&rsquo;t the first to care about design in technology, and he won&rsquo;t be the last, but he moved things so much.</p>
<p>He made beautiful software and hardware like nobody had ever seen before. Crucially, he built tools that helped &ndash; or completely enabled, really &ndash; creatives make their own beautiful work that enriched the world. He completely and utterly validated the view that design could be immensely valuable economically, not just culturally.</p>
<p>Mostly he made it acceptable &ndash; desirable! &ndash; to believe in and practice great, human-centered design in our work and lives. What a gift.</p>
<p>As a people manager and leader, I really struggled with how to think about him. The stories of how brutal he could be on the people around him &ndash; employees, competitors, and everyone else &ndash; are legion, and they&rsquo;re not apocryphal. He could be deeply dehumanizing and belittling to the people around him. Like a lot of people of great vision, which he surely was, he did it all in the name of greatness, of perfection &ndash; but I have enough close friends who have been in the line of Jobs' fire to know how personally destructive it could be, and as a manager I have a hard time with it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he was an unbelievable leader and motivator.</p>
<p>It turns out that I worked at Apple ATG (Advanced Technology Group) in 1994/5 when I was a grad student at Stanford, and then again for all of 1997, when I moved back here from Trilogy.</p>
<p>I remember being at a talk he gave shortly after returning in 1997 as Interim CEO. A bunch of us employees (I was at ATG at the time) were in Town Hall in Building 4 at Infinite Loop to hear him, and he was fired up. Talked a lot about how Apple was going to completely turn things around and become great.</p>
<p>It was a tough time at Apple &ndash; we were trading below book value on the market &ndash; our enterprise value was actually less than our cash on hand. And the rumors were everywhere that we were going to be acquired by Sun. Someone in the audience asked him about Michael Dell&rsquo;s suggestion in the press a few days previous that Apple should just shut down and return the cash to shareholders, and as I recall, Steve&rsquo;s response was: &ldquo;Fuck Michael Dell.&rdquo; Good god, what a message from a CEO! He followed it up by admitting that the stock price was terrible (it was under $10, I think &ndash; pretty sure it was under $2 split-adjusted), and that what they were going to do was reissue everyone&rsquo;s options on the low price, but with a new 3 year vest. He said, explicitly: &ldquo;If you want to make Apple great again, let&rsquo;s get going. If not, get the hell out.&rdquo; I think it&rsquo;s not an overstatement to say that just about everyone in the room loved him at that point, would have followed him off a cliff if that&rsquo;s where he led.</p>
<p>He was also a gifted, gifted operator. One of the struggles we were going through when he came back was that Apple was about the leakiest organization in history &ndash; it had gotten so bad that people were cavalier about it. In the face of all those leaks, I remember the first all company e-mail that Steve sent around after becoming Interim CEO again &ndash; he talked in it about how Apple would release a few things in the coming week, and a desire to tighten up communications so that employees would know more about what was going on &ndash; and how that required more respect for confidentiality. That mail was sent on a Thursday; I remember all of us getting to work on Monday morning and reading mail from Fred Anderson, our then-CFO, who said basically: &ldquo;Steve sent mail last week, he told you not to leak, we were tracking everyone&rsquo;s mail, and 4 people sent the details to outsiders. They&rsquo;ve all been terminated and are no longer with the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well. If it wasn&rsquo;t clear before that the Amelio/Spindler/Sculley days of Apple were over, it was crystal clear then, and good riddance.</p>
<p>As a leader of people, you have to respect how much he (and more importantly, his teams) accomplished. But I struggle with some of the ways that he led, and how they affected good people.</p>
<p>Still.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little uncomfortable with the outpouring of sentiment about people who want to be like Steve. There&rsquo;s a sort of beatification going on that I think misses the point. He was never a nostalgic man at all, and I can&rsquo;t help but feel like he would think this posthumous attention was, in a lot of ways, a waste &ndash; seems like he&rsquo;d have wanted people to get back to inventing.</p>
<p>On Twitter yesterday <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Naval<!-- raw HTML omitted --> nailed it, as he often does: &ldquo;I never met my greatest mentor. I wanted so much to be like him. But, his message was the opposite. Be yourself, with passionate intensity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, I think &ndash; that&rsquo;s the biggest message from Jobs' life. Don&rsquo;t try to be like Steve. Don&rsquo;t try to be like anyone.</p>
<p>Be yourself and work as hard as you can to bring wonderful things into the world. Figure out how you want to contribute and do that, in your own way, on your own terms, as hard as you can, as much as you can, as long as you can.</p>
<p>His most lasting message, I hope, won&rsquo;t be about technology or management or media or communications or even design. The work he did in those areas certainly matters and will continue to &ndash; impossible to ignore it.</p>
<p>Still, I think it&rsquo;s not the main thing, the essential thing.</p>
<p>I hope the message that people really take, really internalize is that being yourself, as hard as you can, is the way to have important and lasting impact on our world. That might be in the context of technology. It might be in the context of technology, or the arts, or sports, or government, or social justice &ndash; or even in the context of your family and close friends.</p>
<p>It almost doesn&rsquo;t matter. The thing that matters most is to figure out what&rsquo;s important to you, what&rsquo;s core to you, and do that. Be that. And do it as well as you possibly can, every single day.</p>

			 <p>As an entrepreneur, I always hated fund raising &ndash; I hated not being in control of situations, I hated being at the mercy of markets and other peoples' schedules. It&rsquo;s a hard thing to take, and a very vulnerable feeling, especially when you&rsquo;re used to running your own company and being mostly in control (more or less). I always was particularly frustrated when VCs would go dark for a week or two, not responding to something or not delivering on something I thought we had agreed on. So since becoming a VC myself, I&rsquo;ve been trying really hard to be responsive and transparent.</p>
<p>Well, these past couple of weeks, I became that guy I&rsquo;ve been frustrated with so often in the past. I dropped a couple of things I was supposed to do with entrepreneurs and they were very frustrated themselves with me &ndash; justifiably so. I think I&rsquo;m mostly caught up on the things that I owe folks, but know that this is an area that I need to &ndash; and want to &ndash; pay attention to so I can minimize it in the future.</p>
<p>For whatever it&rsquo;s worth, I now understand why investors can sometimes become non-responsive for a while. [It&rsquo;s worth noting I&rsquo;m not talking about the type of non-responsive that some people use instead of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to entrepreneurs &ndash; that type of behavior is a real problem, and not something that I personally think is ever really okay. I&rsquo;m talking about disappearing for a few days when you&rsquo;ve got a next step to plan, and then coming back later to follow up.]</p>
<p>This time around, with me, what happened is this: a couple of investments closed, a couple of investments got announced, a couple of companies I&rsquo;m involved with went through financing conversations, and a couple of boards I&rsquo;m on went through particularly meaningful discussions and decisions about the future. On top of which we had a bunch of things going on in our family life.</p>
<p>VC life is paced a little differently than operating, in my experience. It&rsquo;s a lot of meetings with a wide diversity of entities. Entrepreneurs, recruits, recruiters, other investors, PR folks, etc etc. And just like operators, you try to do as much as you possibly can each week. Because of the external-focused nature of so much of VC work, that means a lot of meetings, and your schedule can get sort of jammed up. Which means you also end up scheduling a fair amount of meetings several weeks or more in advance &ndash; which means that you try hard not to move them, since people have been so patient with you in setting them up in the first place.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this normal base meeting load, which can get a little packed &ndash; and then you&rsquo;ve got between 4 and 10 or more organizations who depend on you from time to time for significant involvement and decisions at the board level.</p>
<p>So you build your schedule so that when 1 or 2 of those organizations needs attention in a week, you can accommodate on top of that base meeting load. But when 4 or 5 or 6 company biorhythms line up so that you&rsquo;re critical path on all of them at once, things get a little hairy. And when you add the other commitments of being a parent, child, spouse and friend, the communication load can just overwhelm you.</p>
<p>Which is what happened to me these past 2 weeks. I think I&rsquo;m mostly on the road to being caught up now, but am bummed I caused a few folks (especially entrepreneurs) to become frustrated with me. As an investor &amp; partner I need to get better about it, and think I&rsquo;m learning and adjusting to things pretty quickly now.</p>
<p>One piece of advice I would offer though: if you feel like someone&rsquo;s gone dark &ndash; me or another investor &ndash; just drop them a note asking what&rsquo;s up. Generally that&rsquo;s all the prodding I need to (at least) let you know more clearly what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re very happy to be new investors in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ClearSlide<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a company that builds tools for sales &amp; marketing professionals to communicate &ndash; it&rsquo;s radically simpler than the cumbersome conference tools we use today, and blends synchronous and asynchronous tools to make it easier than ever for sales people to close business. They&rsquo;ve been flying under the radar since starting a couple of years ago &ndash; except with their amazing &amp; rapidly growing customer list, full of raving fans who say they can&rsquo;t live without it now. This morning they&rsquo;ve launched more publicly with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->announcement of new funding<!-- raw HTML omitted --> led by us and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aydin Senkut from Felicis<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who led their initial funding.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s special about their products today is how simple they are to operate: you can get on the phone and do a product demo or share slides in under a minute. It&rsquo;s trivially easy to send information around to customers and be able to understand what they viewed themselves or forwarded along. And it closes the loop by allowing easy sharing of all materials and insight with your coworkers.</p>
<p>And it all works in a web browser, with just a URL. No special installs, no plug-ins needed. I&rsquo;m not talking about just modern browsers, either: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any browser, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->even including IE6. (I&rsquo;ll wait for your gasps of amazement to die down on that one. Also, it&rsquo;s the last time I&rsquo;ll ever mention IE6 on my blog. :-))</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve really thought hard about how to build great tools for sales and marketing people, and it shows.</p>
<p>It was a very quick decision for us &ndash; at Greylock, we talk a lot about &ldquo;our kind of founders&rdquo; &ndash; and Al and Jim are definitely that. Here&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve known Al for some time &ndash; he was the founding CTO of Evite &ndash; it&rsquo;s a little hard to remember, at this distance, what a revelation that product was, but it changed everything &ndash; it let us interact with each other and collaborate in ways that had just been way too painful previously. And it&rsquo;s influenced too many startups to count since then.</p>
<p>Well, he and Jim came in to give a presentation to us about they&rsquo;d done, they jumped right into how their customers love it, how sales are rocketing up, what&rsquo;s next &ndash; and slowly it dawned on me that they were using their own service to present! So I opened up my laptop to type in the URL &amp; access code and bam!, I could see their slides &ndash; took maybe 3 seconds. I got sort of excited so pulled out my iPhone, then my iPad &ndash; everything just worked. And to Al &amp; Jim&rsquo;s credit, none of my futzing around with various electronics fazed them one bit. They just kept moving, unsurprised that there were no glitches in what they&rsquo;d built.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of what we mean when we say &ldquo;our kind of founders&rdquo; &ndash; they&rsquo;re strong product and operating founders, who after changing the world once with Evite, just put their heads down and did the hard work of building something from scratch these past two years. No hype, no fanfare, just customers that love their products and working with them.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re very excited to get involved in the next phase of their growth, and couldn&rsquo;t be happier to be leading their funding round. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Take a look<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m super excited to announce Greylock&rsquo;s investment in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tumblr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>We knew Tumblr was big when we started talking with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over the summer &ndash; over the last year or so, it&rsquo;s practically exploded onto the scene &ndash; it seems like every piece of interesting content and expression you see today has been posted on someone&rsquo;s Tumblr. The numbers back that up &ndash; last month the 30 million blogs on Tumblr generated 13 billion page views.</p>
<p>As we got to know the team there more, it became a more and more obvious decision for us to get involved. We love entrepreneurs who are product visionaries, who have a strong point of view and who want to build great products that affect hundreds of millions of users. David is clearly one of those &ndash; a founder with deep character and a desire to build a meaningful, enduring set of products and a company that users love.</p>
<p>What we didn&rsquo;t know when we started, but learned as we went is that in addition to the ubiquity of Tumblr today, the engagement of users and posters and rebloggers is absolutely off the charts. Good content gets surfaced and spread incredibly rapidly &ndash; more quickly than any other network I&rsquo;ve ever encountered. Lots of reasons for this incredible engagement &ndash; the team at Tumblr has done a wonderful job of figuring out some fundamental and novel avenues for self-expression. I&rsquo;ve found so many interesting posts and perspectives on Tumblr that I never would have found without it &ndash; and it&rsquo;s clear that that&rsquo;s been the experience for millions of other users.</p>
<p>At Greylock, we&rsquo;re always looking for the breakout companies &ndash; because we&rsquo;ve each been involved in building and growing some of the companies with the broadest reach in history (Facebook, LinkedIn, Pandora, Mozilla, and more), we have a huge respect for founders and teams that have gotten to real scale like Tumblr has.</p>
<p>So Greylock and I are thrilled to be involved with Tumblr now, and we&rsquo;re excited to help the company take the next steps forward into becoming an even more powerful platform for self-expression and discovery.</p>
<p>And you can find my own Tumblr at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lilly.tumblr.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. :-)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Earlier this week I got to spend some time with one of my favorite professors and thinkers, B<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ob Sutton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in one of his classes at Stanford. I&rsquo;ve given talks over the years for his classes, but for this one we decided to mix things up, and so he &amp; I just had a conversation. He had a few questions prepared, but, honestly, we have so many shared interests in how to manage people and organizations that it took a first starter question for us to riff on a bit &ndash; and that generated plenty of questions from the class for the rest of the hour.</p>
<p>2 questions stood out to me that I thought were worth writing about some.</p>
<p>The first was this: how do you motivate people? I had to think about this for a bit, because my answer is sort of a cheat: it seems to me that it&rsquo;s too hard to motivate people who aren&rsquo;t. So what you need to do is to hire incredibly motivated people, take them off the leash, and help them be great. Now, I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hiring great people is definitely hard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; but finding motivated people isn&rsquo;t really as hard as it sounds. My strong, strong belief is that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->most people really, really want to be good at what they want to do. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In life, in work, in sport, whatever. People want to be good. Mostly people are willing to put in work to become good. So in my experience the art of getting motivated output is just helping people understand<!-- raw HTML omitted --> what good is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and how to get from here to there. If you show them and help them get there, the motivation usually takes care of itself.</p>
<p>The other interesting question is something like: why do people think you&rsquo;re a good leader? This one I had to think through some &ndash; because I think there are a lot of details that maybe aren&rsquo;t the core reason. But I think the core, long lasting reason is that most people I&rsquo;ve worked with over the last 20 years or so know that I really want to help them win, to help them be good themselves. And that&rsquo;s helped develop some amazing relationships with coworkers.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the secrets. I always want to follow people who can help me become amazing and who want to help me win, and I think that&rsquo;s what people have seen in my own management over the years. It&rsquo;s the decisive factor in my choices I&rsquo;ve made over the years, including coming to Greylock.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s the core of my management philosophy: we&rsquo;re lucky to work in an industry where people are generally very talented, and want to be good &ndash; they want to make a difference and change the world &ndash; so mostly good management is about helping them see how, and helping them get there.</p>
<p>Fun class with Bob as always. (And he&rsquo;s working on some new research with Huggy Rao now that I think is going to be awesomely valuable to read and digest.)</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve written about a ton of times before, I&rsquo;m a font nerd. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Love them.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Could talk about them forever. Could spend 2 days screwing around with my blog looking for just the right look. So I tend to read histories and essays about them whenever I can.</p>
<p>I liked this book, but didn&rsquo;t love it, honestly. Told lots of stories about how fonts have evolved, the various points where things shifted, etc. As much as anything, I liked reading about some of the subtle letterform differences and breakthroughs that various designers made.</p>
<p>So I recommend this for fellow type nerds, but hard to recommend more generally than that, I think.</p>

<p>I really liked this look at Google by Steven Levy &ndash; I&rsquo;ve always liked his insights about the company &ndash; he&rsquo;s had extraordinary access, and I loved the stories about when Google was less gigantic &amp; earth-encompassing. Was fun to read about the exploits of an awesome group of people just out and about and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trying things.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s obviously going through periods of intense change now, and I think that a few years from now this book will feel like it describes a completely different company &ndash; and, really, it maybe already does.</p>
<p>But it was fun to read about so many of my friends and colleagues and what they went through, and I&rsquo;d highly recommend it to anyone in the industry.</p>

			 <p>Mike Shaver has done as much as anyone on the planet over the last ten years to make and keep the Web open, free, and awesome. That&rsquo;s no joke, not a typo, not an exaggeration. The guy has done a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and I&rsquo;m incredibly thankful for his contributions &ndash; they&rsquo;ve just been astonishingly broad, durable &amp; meaningful.</p>
<p>He announced today that he&rsquo;s leaving Mozilla after working there the past 6 years in a variety of roles (and he&rsquo;s been involved even longer, since before Mozilla.org even existed). His absence will be felt acutely by everyone, I think, but his fingerprints are all over the place, and all over the project, and they will be forever - the way Mike thinks is pretty well part of the DNA of the company and project.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I really liked working with Mike - he&rsquo;s smart and humble (sometimes!) and thoughtful - he routinely challenged (and continues to challenge) the way that I thought about problems both on a micro level and more importantly at web scale. He&rsquo;s been involved in too many technology strategy decisions to count, always working for the betterment of the open web, even when it was inconvenient for him and Mozilla. (or maybe especially then!)</p>
<p>And he affected my framing of the problem deeply - I remember one day a couple of years back when we were talking about some market share point, thinking about how incredibly, insanely competitive the browser technology landscape was - and he said to me: &ldquo;Look, this is the world we wanted. And this is the world we made.&rdquo; Wow. Exactly right. He taught me so much about how enormous an impact a group of dedicated people can make.</p>
<p>I quote him a lot when I talk with entrepreneurs of all stripes. I say this: &ldquo;Figure out the world you want, and go make it that way.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the essence of entrepreneurship, and I think it&rsquo;s the essence of Mike.</p>
<p>For my money, that&rsquo;s the best advice anyone can give anyone else, and the best lesson I really, deeply learned from Mike.</p>
<p>Mozilla has been incredibly lucky to have amazing engineering management leadership over the past few years, from Schrep to Shaver and now Damon - just incredible leaders, and the loss of Mike will be obvious, although he&rsquo;ll undoubtedly stay involved in the larger project.</p>
<p>But for myself, I just wanted to give Mike a very public thank you, and to say that I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do next.</p>

			 <p>Right at the moment, Kathy&rsquo;s away, attending the funeral of a close family friend of ours &ndash; someone she&rsquo;s known since college, and someone I&rsquo;ve gotten to know a bit over the years, although she was much closer to him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tragic to lose him &ndash; he was just 45, was an amazing husband and father and friend and practically an uncle to SPL. Tragic that he left behind an amazing wife and 6 year old daughter. And made more tragic because he died at his own hand, after suffering from depression.</p>
<p>Kathy &amp; I have really been struggling with it as everything&rsquo;s unfolded this week &ndash; not even in the same universe as how the family&rsquo;s affected, of course, but it&rsquo;s caused a lot of soul searching and emotionally tough time.</p>
<p>There are so many different aspects, each of which seems too gigantic to really get a handle on. How to understand it in the context of his life? How to help his wife and daughter? How to talk about it with SPL, who loved him so much? And how to think about it all in the context of our own lives?</p>
<p>I think not too many of those questions are answerable quickly, or maybe at all, really. For myself, I have 3 main things I&rsquo;m thinking about while Kathy&rsquo;s at the memorial, celebrating his life.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Life can change profoundly for us in the space of a day, or an hour or a minute. Need to pay attention to now, need to enjoy those around us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing thing to be with friends during a time of extreme emotional distress &ndash; it&rsquo;s obviously so, so hard, but it&rsquo;s also an opportunity for profound grace and dignity to show through, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s manifestly evident this week with his wife and daughter. Such grace and strength in the face of so much uncertainty ahead.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But mostly, we&rsquo;ll miss him and the influence he had on everyone around him. He was always so generous, so engaged, so happy to share time and joy. Kathy &amp; SPL especially loved spending time with him and his family so much.</p>

			 <p>Today will not go down in history as one of the most amazing games of U7 AYSO ever.</p>
<p>It was our first game of the season, and since we have an uneven number of teams in the league, we had a bye week - so we traveled to another nearby region to scrimmage their bye team, too.</p>
<p>We went to the wrong field, as did all the other parents, so we had about half the boys show up. They play by different rules (bigger goals, goalies, 5x5, instead of small goals, no keepers, 4x4). We were all late. No referee, first game of the season, and some emotional reactions to getting scored on by some bigger kids on the other side. And really no subs for our squad, which made for a pretty long 40 minutes.</p>
<p>First half was tough; second half was a lot better, and the boys really worked hard at getting better &ndash; the effort and focus showed; I was very proud of all of them. Some were a little discouraged at the end, but the snack and talking for a few minutes about what each of us did really well and the effort we gave helped a bunch.</p>
<p>But then everyone was off to the play structure and was happy. Best thing about traveling to a new region/school/playground is the novelty of their play structure.</p>
<p>Just a simple, Saturday morning reminder that lots of things don&rsquo;t go like you want them to, lots of situations spin out of control from the start. But it&rsquo;s all good if you get out and try your best, learn something, and get a little time with your friends on the play structure at the end.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s a humbling thing to try to coach 10 6 year olds. Seems like such a small, constrained set of things to think about &ndash; not many kids on the field, not too much action at one time, no real strategy. But I&rsquo;ll tell you: the games and practices seem to fly right by &ndash; it&rsquo;s so much to pay attention to all happening at once &ndash; trying to nudge so many kids in the right direction, while they&rsquo;re all learning so incredibly fast. It&rsquo;s an amazing thing &ndash; always feels pretty chaotic, but also deeply rewarding.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a busy summer for us, one full of change, and I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this post for a while, but just haven&rsquo;t had the time to sit down until today. WARNING! it&rsquo;s a bit saccharine on the topic of being a parent. Beware. :-)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the bittersweetness and ephemeral nature of being a parent &ndash; the overwhelming feeling that I&rsquo;ve had ever since SPL was born is happiness mixed with an acute awareness of how quickly time moves, how quickly SPL is changing and growing and developing.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the essential nature of being a parent is building and creating, and then always letting go. Letting go of the kid that lived in your house yesterday, accepting that they&rsquo;ve changed and are becoming the person they&rsquo;ll be tomorrow. It&rsquo;s been hard for me to explain to people without kids; it&rsquo;s been universally &amp; immediately understood by my friends with kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about it here in the context of our trip to Disneyland this summer.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s easy to be cynical about The Walt Disney Company and the various parks and properties that they run &ndash; and I&rsquo;m often cynical myself about them. But I have to say that I really love going to Disney World and Disneyland &ndash; I always have &ndash; and I really, really love going with Kathy &amp; SPL. I love being there, I love exploring with them, and none of the machinery of manipulation of the place really bothers me all that much.</p>
<p>This year, with SPL being 6, was a fun mix of wanting to venture out on his own and wanting to hug tight to Kathy and me. It felt like we&rsquo;re crossing a line towards more and more independence.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a story in 4 pictures.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Above and beyond everything else, the trip is a time that the three of us get concentrated, dedicated time with not much to worry about other than just being a family.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the best parts about an experience like this is the combination of familiar and completely new things to experience together. Above is a picture of SPL &amp; me watching one of the parades, talking about what we saw together, processing it together.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At just 6 years old, SPL still gets excited by the characters, loves hugs and holding close. We didn&rsquo;t get too many pictures of it, but lots of times SPL grabbed onto Kathy and me &ndash; he&rsquo;s still small enough that he wants the safety of his parents, and isn&rsquo;t really 100% ready to take on the experiences by himself.</p>
<p>Still, my favorite picture of the trip this year is this one:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s on one of the smaller roller coasters in the park &ndash; in Toon Town, and this was the very first time he was able to ride the coaster by himself (I was in the seat behind, obviously).</p>
<p>I just love this picture because it represents so much about the way SPL is beginning to engage with the world now &ndash; in an &ldquo;arms up, even though it&rsquo;s a little scary for me&rdquo; mode.</p>
<p>And as hard as it is when on the 2nd day of kindergarten he shoos you out of the room or runs away from you across the playground &ndash; and it is hard, and emotional &ndash; again, tough to describe to anyone without kids.</p>
<p>As hard as that feeling is to experience, it&rsquo;s also exactly, exactly the thing you want for your child. An eagerness to engage with the new, to run unafraid towards the unknown.</p>
<p>So for me, that&rsquo;s the essential quality of being a parent. Spending endless hours building and caring, and then just letting go and watching. The wisest thing anyone&rsquo;s said to me since SPL was born is this: &ldquo;The days are long, but the years are short.&rdquo; That seems awfully right to me, and sort of wonderful, too.</p>

			 <p>Very very interesting news about Google buying Motorola Mobility this morning. It&rsquo;s got so many implications it&rsquo;s tough to take in all at once, so wanted to capture a few thoughts quickly.</p>
<p>First thing worth pointing out, though, is this: we don&rsquo;t actually know the shape of the whole deal at this point. Will Google keep the MOTO hardware business? Keep the patents and sell the hardware side? Keep both? It&rsquo;s hard to know how their internal evaluation went, and what they&rsquo;ll do from here, so a lot of this is really hard to speculate about.</p>
<p>Having said that, a few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s another instance in a long history of software (and now Internet) business devouring the previous generation&rsquo;s hardware businesses. Internet business are inherently more leveraged: distribution power trumps almost everything else, especially in a phase where the technology portion is maturing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>along those lines, it&rsquo;s interesting to think about what happens next for Samsung, RIM, HTC, Nokia, but I&rsquo;m way more interested in what the software players do. All eyes in that regard are on Microsoft, but I think the more interesting long term questions are for Facebook and Amazon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 things it&rsquo;s clear that Google didn&rsquo;t buy MOTO for: its margins or its ~20k employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seems like Google definitely wanted the IP portfolio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and it seems to me that, assuming they keep the hardware business, that they want Motorola because it gives Google full control over the hardware and software stack, which is the only way that they&rsquo;ll ever be able to even approach the excellent UX fit &amp; finish of the Apple offerings. I feel like that&rsquo;s one of the top drivers, and maybe the most important one over the long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One other thing that this merger is decidedly not about is distribution &ndash; if anything, Google&rsquo;s distribution power with respect to Android is somewhat weakened, at least in the short-to-medium term, as they&rsquo;re undoubtedly going to cause some grief with partners Samsung and HTC. Feels like Google has calculated that control over getting the experience right trumps any distribution help they might get from their handset partners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this lines up pretty well with my post about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Screens, Storage &amp; Networks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last week &ndash; the last 60 days have seen Google push hard to get in the top tier on Screens (MOTO) and Networks (Google+).</p>
<p>My most esoteric point I&rsquo;ve left for last, though: one of the unfortunate consequences of this development is that I think it will move perceptions of big corporations building open software (and in this particular instance, I&rsquo;m specifically talking about open source software) at least a few more notches towards the cynical. The question that everyone will ask anytime a company tries an open experiment like Android in the future, the inevitable line of questioning will be: &ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s open now, but for how long?&rdquo; Whether premeditated or not, the path of Android has been from wide open to asserting more and more control &ndash; and this is another data point on that path. I&rsquo;m not criticizing or indicting anyone for this &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s essentially just a natural evolution and response to market conditions that require tighter integration. I think in a lot of ways it&rsquo;s inevitable in technology networks for this to happen. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->And I&rsquo;ve written about it a bit before.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) My only real sadness here is that it&rsquo;ll move cynicism on corporate open source efforts up one more notch, and that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>Overall, though, fascinating day, fascinating time. Big moves!</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s impossible not to think a lot about data these days. We&rsquo;re generating it all the time, constantly. On our phones, on our televisions, on our laptops, in public spaces. And increasingly the best startups and Internet giants are using data to make better and better product decisions and designs.</p>
<p>Today at Greylock we announced that DJ Patil is joining us as Data Scientist in Residence, as far as I know the first time any VC has had a position quite like that. It&rsquo;s a huge addition for us, and the expression of a bunch of deeply held beliefs about the state of the art in designing great products.</p>
<p>But as I talk about using data for design, I find that there&rsquo;s a lot of misunderstanding about it &ndash; some people have the sense that it somehow makes designers less powerful, that you&rsquo;re basing decisions based purely on mechanical measures rather than designer intuition and genius.</p>
<p>In my view, however, data is what makes designers not only strong, but primary. It&rsquo;s what turns designers from artists into the most important decision makers in a company, because it&rsquo;s understanding the data that lets you understand what your users are doing, how they&rsquo;re using (or not using) your products, and what you can be doing better.</p>
<p>It made me think back a bit to my own training as a UX designer (we called it HCI then) at Stanford in the mid-nineties, when the field was just starting to develop. We would spent a lot of time on ethnography, need finding, doing paper prototypes and then doing basic mockups and user testing. And we&rsquo;d get 80% of the way there then go and build it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the state of the art is to still do need finding and some mockups early, but to get to a working prototype as quickly as you can, that&rsquo;s instrumented so that you can tell what&rsquo;s happening and figure out whether you&rsquo;re on the right track or not.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s generally the right approach, but it&rsquo;s worth noting: instrumented prototypes can really only get you to local maxima &ndash; they can help you find ways to tweak and optimize the basic design you&rsquo;ve got, but they can never help you find a radically different and better solution.</p>
<p>So when I talk about using data &ndash; and I talk about it a LOT &ndash; what I&rsquo;m talking about is a mixture of the artisan/designer-led designs along with using data to figure out what&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>Thinking about it the other day, I was reminded of one of my favorite sayings that I learned from Bob Sutton: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Fight like you&rsquo;re right, listen like you&rsquo;re wrong.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Bob&rsquo;s an organizational theorist, and what he means is really a paraphrase of something that I think Andy Grove said, which is that he wanted all his people to have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strong beliefs, loosely held. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In other words, he always wanted people to come in with a point of view &ndash; a design, as it were &ndash; but to be willing to moved off of that point of view in the face of data.</p>
<p>So the modern, design oriented framing is this:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Design like you&rsquo;re right. Read the data like you&rsquo;re wrong.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In other words, you should always design the product you think/believe/know is what people want &ndash; there&rsquo;s a genius in that activity that no instrumentation, no data report, no analysis will ever replace.  But at the same time you should be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->relentless <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in looking at the data on how people actually use what you&rsquo;ve built, and you should be looking for things that show which assumptions you&rsquo;ve made are wrong, because those are the clues to what can be made better. We all like to see all the up-and-to-the-right happy MBA charts, and those are important. But they don&rsquo;t help you get any better than you already are.</p>
<p>I wish we taught more of this blend, because all of the products we use would get better.</p>
<p>So: design like you&rsquo;re right; listen like you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday my Twitter follower count ticked over 50,000 for the first time. And while I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly call that a lifetime achievement or milestone, it has caused me to reflect a little bit on Twitter specifically and the Internet more generally, so I thought I would write down some of those thoughts here.</p>
<p>Off the top, let me say this: I really love Twitter. A lot. I use it every day &ndash; I don&rsquo;t always post things (although most times I do), but I always read and discover new things &ndash; it&rsquo;s become integral to me in a bunch of ways. I share interesting articles about technology and startups and politics and literature that I find. I link to my blog posts like this one. I ask questions, mostly about travel and technology. I vent about things (I&rsquo;m looking at you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@unitedairlines<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). I talk about TV and music that I like. I track a bunch of my friends and coworkers and how they&rsquo;re doing. And I make a lot of dumb jokes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s clear at this point is that I&rsquo;m not a particularly typical Twitter user. As services evolve, they find their main use cases, their reasons for existing. You&rsquo;ve got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Facebook<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for interacting with friends in symmetric ways; you&rsquo;ve got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quora<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for getting high quality answers to questions; you&rsquo;ve got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tumblr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for expressing a synthesis of media that in aggregate represents you.</p>
<p>Twitter has evolved, I think, into essentially a celebrity broadcast medium. Now, I&rsquo;m using the term &lsquo;celebrity&rsquo; a little broadly &ndash; there are the Biebers and Gagas, of course, but there are also the CNNs and NPRs of news, and the Saccas of the tech world, and the long middle part of the curve of bands and critics and pundits that have tens or hundreds of thousands of followers. It seems obvious to me at this point that this is really what Twitter is for: tracking our mega and mini broadcasters, being able to follow along in real time to see what they&rsquo;re doing, writing and what they&rsquo;re amplifying from others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of how I use it, but I think that my use case is somewhat more complicated, which makes my tweets pretty atypical. My tweet stream is more like a mix of broadcasting, retweets, active conversations with friends, debates with other techies, and a bunch of snarky jokes.</p>
<p>I think there are a few reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, because I&rsquo;m more of a &ldquo;Twitter native&rdquo; &ndash; that is, someone who&rsquo;s been active on the system since the first million users, I&rsquo;ve been part of the &lsquo;figuring out&rsquo; conversations that have happened, mostly as a user. So I&rsquo;ve gone through several generations of the product before it landed on celebrity broadcast as the center, and some of those generations of use case have really stuck with me.</p>
<p>Second, I developed a bunch of my patterns while I worked at Mozilla, a uniquely open organization where Twitter really fit. Because we don&rsquo;t have a ton of internal systems for closed communications by design, we like to have conversations in the open, on public wikis, on open IRC channels, and on Twitter. And because I had management responsibility of a distributed, global organization, it helped me to kind of keep track of folks I wasn&rsquo;t able to see every day. Beyond that, it let me have some interactions in a public way with people that I could model so that others would see them and (maybe) learn from them. In a lot of ways, I think of it as the modern equivalent of Managing by Walking Around, popularized by Hewlett-Packard long ago. It&rsquo;s easy to brush off this use case as not real, but I really did use it a lot for helping to manage at Mozilla.</p>
<p>And while Mozilla is obviously unique in its openness, in a lot of ways the Silicon Valley ecosystem shares some of the characteristics, with lots of actors who are decentralized and distributed, working in different ways but able to share public communication channels like this.</p>
<p>The third reason I&rsquo;m quirky in my use, I think, is that I make so many jokes on it. I&rsquo;ve always been a guy that&rsquo;s most comfortable at the back of the classroom making jokes. It&rsquo;s not necessarily the part of my personality I&rsquo;m most proud of, but it&rsquo;s what I do. I&rsquo;m happiest in the back, scribbling semi-related ideas to what&rsquo;s going on, making jokes to myself or friends. Twitter gives me a pretty good way to do that sort of thing without being disruptive, and it&rsquo;s fun for me.</p>
<p>I guess last is the fact that a lot of close friends also spend a fair amount of time on it, so keeping up with them and interacting with them there is fun and rewarding.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve moved up to 50k followers and past, I think it&rsquo;s going to start changing how I use it a bit, for better or worse. It&rsquo;s becoming somewhat more of a broadcast/audience thing and less of a group-of-friends thing. It remains extremely useful and integral to me, but probably will be so in different ways.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough for now &ndash; just thought I&rsquo;d capture a few thoughts here that wouldn&rsquo;t fit in 140 characters. :-)</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been at Greylock 6 months now, and have a bunch of learnings and observations I&rsquo;ll start sharing on the blog soon!</p>
<p>But in this post I&rsquo;m really happy to share that the first investment that I&rsquo;ve led is in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Citrus Lane<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; an investment we made a few months ago.</p>
<p>Citrus Lane is a modern subscription e-commerce company that&rsquo;s focused on getting awesome, healthy, useful &amp; delightful products to young families. They launched their site and products last week. :-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really, really excited to be involved with the company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exited about the category: subscription commerce is coming like a freight train; we&rsquo;re in a period where the way we buy products and services is changing dramatically and quickly. The comprehensiveness of Amazon&rsquo;s offerings and the ubiquity of the modern logistics chain have paved the way for more thoughtful, curated, unique offerings to consumers, highly targeted by interest, lifestyle and personal tastes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about the particular sector: as a family with a kindergartner, I&rsquo;m acutely aware of how you go from month to month never knowing whether you should be doing better taking care of your children, thinking there must be better ways to do things and better products. It&rsquo;s obvious to me that we&rsquo;ve made product and process decisions that will last for years. And it&rsquo;s super obvious that young parents, and especially moms, control trillions of dollars of product decisions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m particularly excited to work with the CEO &amp; Founder, Mauria Finley. I&rsquo;ve known Mauria for more than 15 years &ndash; she&rsquo;s a Stanford-trained Computer Scientist with a particular expertise in product design, and has held product leadership roles at Ebay, PayPal, Good, AOL and elsewhere. She&rsquo;s fantastic, and a highly motivated first time CEO. She&rsquo;s been great to work with so far and I think will continue to be tops.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s putting together a very interesting team that includes Claire Hough, her co-founder &amp; CTO &ndash; previously of NexTag, Blue Martini, Netscape, Napster and more.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re launched! Go take a look and see what you think. Watch this space (and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->follow them on Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!). :-)</p>
<p>[PS &ndash; I&rsquo;ve done several other investments, but they&rsquo;ve been from our Discovery Fund, which we typically don&rsquo;t announce publicly unless the companies really want us to. This is somewhat different in that I&rsquo;m on the board of directors and it&rsquo;s a more significant level of investment.]</p>

			 <p>On Monday we got back to the house after our 4th of July festivities to see this scene:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s a sofa! In front of our house. And not one of those hip, polyurethane outdoor couches from Design Within Reach, but more like a ratty, heavily used, might-be-something-living-in-it type of couch.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, we were a little surprised by it, and somewhat mystified by its presence. (And a little stumped on how to, you know, get rid of it.)</p>
<p>Anyway, imagine our surprise the next day, when Kathy looked out the window and saw this scene:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy sitting on the couch! Nice! And, again, not totally what we were expecting.</p>
<p>So we puzzled over that a while. With a little sleuthing, and help from my Twitter friends, it&rsquo;s now obvious what&rsquo;s happened: we&rsquo;ve been visited by the Couch Fairy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a story as old as time, and we all know how it goes: an always working, ambitious person (the protagonist) returns home from a trip to find a sofa on their lawn that they weren&rsquo;t expecting. After a little while, they discover a grouchy, impish old man lives on the couch, although he comes and goes at some unpredictable intervals. When asked questions directly, the old man (who&rsquo;s really The Couch Fairy, as we all know) never answers about who he is or what he&rsquo;s there for, or, indeed, where the couch came from. All attempts to remove the couch &ndash; whether by having people take it away, chopping it up into little pieces, setting it on fire, whatever &ndash; ultimately fail, as the couch keeps returning over and over.</p>
<p>After weeks or months of this type of activity, the protagonist ultimately accepts that you can&rsquo;t always take care of things in a direct, get-it-done! type of manner, but sometimes have to accept that things are how they are &ndash; so he or she takes a break, sits on the couch and just slows down to watch the world go by with the Couch Fairy for an afternoon. And they realize that they like this newfound slower pace of life.</p>
<p>You know how it ends &ndash; the next morning they come out to sit on the couch again and watch the world go by with the Fairy, but both the couch and the Fairy are gone, nowhere to be found. But the main character has learned to slow down a little bit, enjoy the world around them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s clearly what we&rsquo;ve got going on here. Nothing to do but slow down, accept the situation and roll with it.</p>
<p>Like all archetypal stories, this is one that&rsquo;s been told &amp; retold dozens of times. The canonical first known telling is, of course, Hans Christen Andersen&rsquo;s The Couch Fairy (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Das Sofa Elf<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), which is the one we&rsquo;re all familiar with from our childhoods.</p>
<p>Then there was Kafka&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sofa,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the absurdist Austrian play from the 20s &ldquo;There is no couch.&rdquo; (Es gibt keine Couch.)</p>
<p>And of course there have been many movies, including:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And don&rsquo;t forget David Foster Wallace&rsquo;s take: &ldquo;Who will speak for the Ottoman?&rdquo; featured in the New Yorker in 2006. It&rsquo;s a long essay, and pretty esoteric in my opinion, but really a must read if you&rsquo;re interested in the canon.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And of course we&rsquo;re all extremely excited for the upcoming 2012 Broadway retelling &ldquo;Couched!&rdquo; which features Whoopi Goldberg as the Fairy with Nathan Lane set to sing the protagonist&rsquo;s role.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&mdash;-<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So that&rsquo;s where we stand. Gotta wait the old guy out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Thanks to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@shave<!-- raw HTML omitted -->r, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@mart3ll<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@humphd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &amp; others for the clues to figure things out this morning!]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll be giving a talk in a few minutes to a conference of high achieving high schoolers called Adventures of the Mind. Amazing collection of students and speakers. Anyway, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to say.</p>
<hr>
<p>Adventures of the Mind 2011 Talk</p>
<p>A couple of years ago when I gave a talk for Adventures of the Mind 2009 in Princeton, I talked about how important the people around you are to success. Because you never know what the big decision points in your life are, it&rsquo;s really hard to intentionally design your life. But you CAN design who you spend time with, and being around amazing people &ndash; always trying to put yourself into rooms with people who are smarter than you, even if it makes you feel bad &ndash; that that strategy will tend to mean that great opportunities will find you.</p>
<p>So that was a &ldquo;HOW&rdquo; talk. How to make sure to be around great choices in your life.</p>
<p>Today I want to give more of a WHAT &amp; WHY talk.  I always like starting with the punchline, so here&rsquo;s the punchline for my talk: everyone in this room is amazing potential. But we need to move potential into action, into change, into improvement. Everyone in this room needs to think about how you want the world to be, AND THEN YOU NEED TO GO MAKE THE WORLD YOU WANT.</p>
<p>Make the world you want to live in. That&rsquo;s the only way you get it.</p>
<p>But let me start by giving you a little background about me. When I was graduating high school 20 years ago and getting ready to go to Stanford, I figured I would be a physicist. That was the plan until about the 3rd problem set of my Stanford career, which was approximately the hardest thing I&rsquo;d ever seen. It was immediately obvious to me that I could never be world class as a physicist, so I went looking for things I could be world class at. And my next stop for several years was computer science and user interface design, which I was pretty good at. But again, as I got out into the working world, it became clear again that while I could be really good at interaction design, there was no way I could be one of the best in the world at it. So, again, I went looking for what I was good at, and what I found was that I was really good at thinking about how to organize people, how to lead them, how to manage them. That I felt I could be world class at, and that&rsquo;s been what I&rsquo;ve done, working at startups in Silicon Valley for the 20 years since then.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve meandered around doing interesting things with awesome people since then, but am best known at this point for the job before the one that I have now, as the CEO of Mozilla, who makes Firefox.</p>
<p>So how many of you have used Firefox?</p>
<p>And how many of you knew that it&rsquo;s made be a tiny 300 person company that&rsquo;s a non-profit?</p>
<p>I want to show you a short video about Mozilla, Firefox, and what a unique organization it is.</p>
<p>(video)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done over the last 5 or 6 years, and it&rsquo;s been amazing. Just trying to make the web better, getting to about 450 million users in the world, breaking the Microsoft monopoly on browsers and operating systems. Making the world a little more like we wanted it.</p>
<p>It was sort of an accident that I ended up at Mozilla though &ndash; let me tell you that story: after my own startup, I was trying to find my next thing &ndash; I actually wanted to be a venture capitalist, which is what I am now, but in 2005 I couldn&rsquo;t find the right place for me. I ran into Mitchell Baker, who ran the Mozilla project, then about 15 employees total, and told her I really liked what they were doing, and that I&rsquo;d like to help. She said great! So we had this awesome brainstorming session, felt like we could make things better, I went home and wrote up this really long e-mail about what I thought she should do. And she never responded to me. This happened a couple of times, and I eventually said, &ldquo;Shit. If I want to help, I probably need to go actually work there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But still I was on the fence.</p>
<p>Then something lucky happened: Mitchell invited me to go to a meeting with her and the other leaders at Yahoo (this was back when Yahoo was still marginally cool), where we would meet with Jerry Yang. So I tagged along, excited to meet Jerry. Well, he showed up 45 minutes late for an hour long meeting, and he started yelling at us right away. Long story about exactly why he yelled at us, but roughly it&rsquo;s because people were adopting Firefox so quickly that it was causing Yahoo real market share problems. He yelled at us for a while, but I really wasn&rsquo;t listening that closely, because it was then and there that I decided I had to join Mozilla full time.</p>
<p>I figured if we could get a billionaire to get so angry that he yelled at us, we were probably doing a bunch of things really, really right.</p>
<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve discovered that it&rsquo;s actually a lot easier than you might think to get billionaires to yell at you, but those are stories for another time, maybe once you&rsquo;re all over 21.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my point: everyone expected me to go be a venture capitalist or start my next for profit company &ndash; but I accidentally found an opportunity at this weird, funky non-profit that gave me a massive chance to make the world a little closer to the way I wanted. So I couldn&rsquo;t escape the gravitational pull, and signed up. Best decision of my career.</p>
<p>Let me shift gears - today I&rsquo;m a partner at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. We find interesting, early startups to invest in and help them grow into great companies that change the world. We&rsquo;ve been very fortunate to find and work with some of the most successful companies in history, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Pandora.</p>
<p>(And I have to tell you quickly about one of the incredible companies we&rsquo;re involved with that just announced - it&rsquo;s a company called Lytro, and I figure they&rsquo;re about to change photography forever, by introducing what&rsquo;s called a &lsquo;light field camera&rsquo; - a camera that doesn&rsquo;t just take a picture of one plane of focus, but rather captures all the light rays in a scene at once, which means you can do things like focus the picture after the fact. Incredible.)</p>
<p>And these are incredible times in Silicon Valley and around the world, with technology having such a huge impact &ndash; more things are changing, for more people, more quickly than in any time in history. We&rsquo;re going through a massive, and fast, revolution. Apple and Facebook and Google and Mozilla and others are changing the way we work, the way we communicate, the way we live.</p>
<p>There are 3 massive shifts happening all at one time:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The rise of ubiquitous and mobile computing: phones and tablets are going to be 10 or 100 times bigger than anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen. Soon we&rsquo;ll have 2 billion smart phones on the planet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn have connected everyone together, which means collaboration happens at a wicked fast pace. And it&rsquo;s speeding up. You can get your products to hundreds of millions of people in a matter of days now. Think about that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve figured out how to make the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; work. So anytime you&rsquo;re anywhere, from any device, you can get to your pictures, your data, your life.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing like this has ever happened before. I can&rsquo;t overstate how massive this is.</p>
<p>But we still have many choices to make. Do you want to live in an Apple defined world? Or a Google one? Or a Facebook and Twitter world? The point I&rsquo;m trying to make is that technology choices have implications. Technology platforms have points of view. The choices that you make matter. And an Apple-y world is very very different than a Googley world. So which one of those do you want?</p>
<p>I suspect you all know that the answer is &ldquo;none of the above&rdquo; &ndash; as you all go become scientists and engineers and entrepreneurs and citizens, I hope you think hard not about whose technology world view you want to adopt, but rather what the world you want to live in looks like, and that you think hard about how to make that world happen.</p>
<p>For me, that&rsquo;s the definition of creativity and entrepreneurship. Finding the things in our world that are broken, and then going and fixing the ones you care about.</p>
<p>So I hope all of you head into your next phase of life with the mindset of an entrepreneur, looking for things to fix, wondering why things aren&rsquo;t the way they should be. And then going and making the world the way you want it to be by starting the next Facebook or LinkedIn or Kiva or Mozilla.</p>

		<a href="https://johnolilly.com/2011/06/24/my-shoulder-a-year-after.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-06-24 21:48:22 &#43;0700">Jun 24, 2011</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This may not be of much interest to folks who usually read my blog, but I&rsquo;ve been trying to document how my shoulder has felt - after dislocation, leading up to surgery, and through rehab - because when I was going through it I just couldn&rsquo;t find much information about how it actually felt to go through it. So I&rsquo;m trying to make sure I put up some info on it in case others are looking for it, too.</p>
<p>To recap, last May I dislocated my left shoulder - not the first time, but more like the 15th, although it was the first time in the past 10 years or so. I had it surgically repaired in about 1990, and so went to see the doc, who recommended surgery again. (I&rsquo;ve documented that previously, but don&rsquo;t have the links handy - will update.)</p>
<p>The surgery was just about a year ago now, and went well, followed by a month in a sling and about three months of intensive rehab with a physical therapist, and I&rsquo;ve been working out with weights and such pretty consistently since then.</p>
<p>The short story is that at this point, my shoulder seems really good, but not without issues. It&rsquo;s probably stronger than it&rsquo;s ever been - I can do way more, and more controlled, pull ups and push ups than I ever have in my life - feeling incredibly great about that. But I do notice my shoulder a lot. I find that I still pull my shoulders (hunching) forward a lot, sort of subconsciously protecting the joint. And I still can&rsquo;t sleep on my left side without the pressure on the shoulder pushing against where the capsule was replaced, which both hurts and feels vulnerable. The shoulder clicks more than it used to (I think that&rsquo;s essentially a bone related problem from the injury, not particularly related to the surgery). And sometimes it feels a little unstable, like it might dislocate again - but that really could be in my head - tough to know for sure.</p>
<p>But all things considered, very happy I was aggressive in getting it fixed, very happy with my doc and physical therapist, and optimistic that the repair will serve me well for a long time.</p>

			 <p>Since coming to Greylock full time in January, I&rsquo;ve been talking to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of people. I did that before, of course &ndash; I&rsquo;ve always spent a lot of time building my network &ndash; but in this role it&rsquo;s significantly more than ever before. So I&rsquo;ve been talking with tons of entrepreneurs, tons of techies, tons of executives, tons of students &ndash; for a variety of reasons, including funding, recruiting for roles here at Greylock, etc.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve been really, really struck by is how significant the first 4 or 5 years of a person&rsquo;s career seems to be on how they think and how they approach the world. It&rsquo;s typically very easy to tell if someone started their career at Google or Apple or Microsoft or Paypal or a bunch of others, even when they&rsquo;re 15 years into their career and well removed from that first job. You can just see it in the way they approach problems. These are gross simplifications and overgeneralizations, but Googlers tend to think about things in a data and machine learning sort of way. Amazon folk (Amazonians?) tend to think in terms of testing and yield. And other companies that shall remain nameless are notable in that their alumni have absurdly good PowerPoint skills. (Which, sadly, is not actually a positive indicator.)</p>
<p>So like I say, gross oversimplifications and gross generalizations, but you really can tell a lot about where a person started their career by how they act and think about things. (And I guess others have had this insight about organizational imprinting before &ndash; here&rsquo;s an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HBS study<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and here&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what Diego wrote about his early time at HP<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a few weeks back.)</p>
<p>Since I was in Austin this week, where I started my career at Trilogy, I reflected some on how I was imprinted by being there &ndash; and for all the weird, screwed up world views I developed there (and believe me, it was like 90% screwed up world view), the thing that imprinted most is an insane focus on recruiting insanely talented people. As a company, we were relentless about getting the smartest, most driven, most talented people we could. We were a tiny company, but going toe to toe with giants in on campus recruiting, for example &ndash; and I think we were probably about the best tech company at recruiting anywhere in the US in the mid-90s.</p>
<p>So thank goodness I went to Trilogy, because that intense focus on recruiting at all levels, getting ridiculously talented people to work with and getting out of their way &ndash; that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been absolutely critical and foundational for me my whole career. When I tell people I worked at Trilogy, most people today don&rsquo;t know what that is, even. But I&rsquo;m very happy to trade off a brand name on the resume for getting recruiting into my DNA in a fundamental way. It changed everything.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been super busy lately, and haven&rsquo;t had a lot of time to write here unfortunately, but hoping to fix that in the coming few days. Lots to write about; wanted to put down a few placeholders of things I&rsquo;m planning to write about.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On Scaling: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spent some time talking with a professor friend of mine over the past few weeks about how organizations scale to have massive impact; realized that there are fundamental differences in approach. On one side, you assume that the core that you have &ndash; yourself, a small org, whatever &ndash; is the essence and you want to extend that to the rest of the world &ndash; but in some way, the new converts will always be pale reflections of the core. On the other side, you assume that you&rsquo;ve figured out how to do something interesting, and want to enable lots of other people to do it as well as unexpected and new things &ndash; so the assumption here is that by scaling you increase diversity, increase quality, and you get <!-- raw HTML omitted -->better <!-- raw HTML omitted -->overall as you get bigger, not weaker &amp; thinner.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not Understanding Modern Technology &amp; Products: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an NYT article a month or so back<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, HBS professor David Yoffee said this: &lsquo;“The problem for both Firefox and Chrome is how are they going to  convince customers that they have a significantly better product, worth  the hassle of actually going and downloading something that’s new and  different.”&rsquo; This was very surprising to me &ndash; it&rsquo;s such old thinking, not really in line with the way technology products (Internet products in particular) spread in today&rsquo;s world. I don&rsquo;t know Prof Yoffee, but in my view, technology products spread today much more like political campaigns and memes, not as careful, considered evaluations of whether other alternatives are better than what someone has today. I&rsquo;m not putting a value judgement on that phenomenon at all, just noting it, and think that it&rsquo;s worth exploring a bit.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Living Inside Everyone Else&rsquo;s Greatest Hits Albums: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just some thoughts about how status feeds are changing the way we think about other peoples' lives, and our own. Maybe a profound observation, maybe a banal one, who can tell?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My First 4 Months in VC: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve been at Greylock full time now for about 4 months, have some initial observations and things to write about. Steep learning curve, very busy time (and also busy personally), but want to take some time to deconstruct the experience so far and share what I can. (I also have a post on why I joined Greylock in particular to write. Quick hint: it&rsquo;s the same reason that Soylent Green tastes so delicious.)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alone Together, by Sherry Turkle: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interesting book, finished it a while back but haven&rsquo;t had time to write about it yet. Lots in there.</p>
<p>And then a few other odds &amp; ends, including a great book I&rsquo;m reading about the history of the Eastern Roman Empire from about 300 AD until 1500 AD. I get that this will be of incredibly limited and esoteric interest to even my nerdiest friends, but I&rsquo;m loving it. Fish gotta swim.</p>
<p>Hopefully more soon. What else should I write about? :-)</p>

			 <p>I doubt this post will be of must interest to anyone but future-me, and maybe Kathy, and maybe my folks in a sort of I-knew-he-would-eventually-feel-like-this sort of way. But that&rsquo;s cool with me. :-)</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Kathy&rsquo;s been gone to Kentucky for a few days for her grandmother&rsquo;s funeral (and celebration of a vibrant life well-lived), which means that SPL and I have been on our own. It&rsquo;s the first time that he and I have been on our own for more than about a day, and it&rsquo;s been a really interesting experience. And really good for us, I think &ndash; I&rsquo;m coming to a bunch of different realizations.</p>
<p>First off, a prosaic one that&rsquo;s going to sound completely obvious: being the sole adult responsible for a child is an incredible, consuming responsibility. There are no real breaks, there aren&rsquo;t any times when you&rsquo;re able to totally think about non-kid-related work. You&rsquo;re always either just coming in from dropping him off somewhere or about to pick him up, or wondering whether you remembered to put his lunch together or reminded him to wear socks or some other damn thing. It&rsquo;s constant, in ways that I&rsquo;m not used to. And it&rsquo;s a lot of work. So many things to keep track of.</p>
<p>Now, don&rsquo;t misunderstand. I know that lots of people deal with lots more complex lives than my life with just one essentially well-behaved five year old. I&rsquo;ll tell you candidly: I have no idea how single parents with more than 1 kid do it. Profound, profound respect for those that do.</p>
<p>Second, also obvious: Kathy makes everything go here; she makes everything possible. I feel like I&rsquo;m a very involved dad, but man, the stuff that she takes care of all day long every day is just about rocket science for me to remember. Let&rsquo;s just say that SPL would be a significantly hungrier, more sunburned, and more hatless kid if I were in charge. Kathy&rsquo;s everything here.</p>
<p>But beyond all the details of making a kid&rsquo;s life work and balancing that with your own work, I&rsquo;m learning a lot by being with SPL so many more hours each day. Since it&rsquo;s just the two of us, we sort of process our days with each other exclusively (he does it by talking about which super-villians we&rsquo;re pretending to be, but you know, he&rsquo;s five. It&rsquo;s cool.).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding that without Kathy, I tend to be too focused on getting things done, getting all our chores done, making use of the time we have. Today was a busy day and we did a lot, including ordering new glasses for me (5 years overdue), replacing my 9 year old car, getting haircuts for both of us, doing a workout, and various other chores. We played a little Lego Star Wars, too, which is good, but I can&rsquo;t really figure out how to get past this one level in Episode 1, so I might have to do some research tonight. SPL did amazingly well throughout, but by the end of the day he was a little more fragile emotionally than usual. I think it&rsquo;s because I didn&rsquo;t build in a bunch of down time in the schedule just to play and be five. There&rsquo;s a harder, more focused edge to the way I think about time that probably doesn&rsquo;t give SPL everything he needs. So I&rsquo;m a little too focused, I think.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I&rsquo;m finding I&rsquo;m also not focused enough &ndash; that is, I&rsquo;m not focused quite enough on the right things about some of our interactions. I&rsquo;m too distracted, thinking about too many other things.</p>
<p>My takeaway here, other than the obvious one that Kathy does so much to make our family work, and that the three of us form a really special and functional unit, is that I want to reorient what I focus on, that I need to struggle again (and always) to be more present and in the moment. None of this is that new, it&rsquo;s just more profoundly and acutely felt when you get a few days together with another soul &ndash; and that&rsquo;s another takeaway: dedicated, exclusive, coherent time with your family moves relationships ahead unlike anything else.</p>
<p>So: we&rsquo;re missing Kathy and are glad she&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow; have gotten a ton of stuff done; are planning on not doing much at all tomorrow until Kathy gets back into SFO; and: I&rsquo;m a lucky, lucky guy, for lots of reasons, chief of which are Kathy and SPL.</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway, a few weeks back I was lucky to attend HCI:20 at Stanford, a celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Human-Computer Interaction program at Stanford, started by Terry Winograd. There were a bunch of themes that I found noteworthy, and it was great to reflect on the origins and history of the program. And it was really fantastic to hear colleagues and friends of Professor Winograd talk about his contributions and impact over many years.</p>
<p>One of the first speakers talked about a paper Winograd published in January 1971 &ndash; coincidentally the month I was born. It was an AI paper on some work he was doing at the AI Lab at MIT &ndash; really focused on computers understanding human language. And that was Terry&rsquo;s focus for quite a long while, doing work with Flores on computers and cognition. It&rsquo;s amazing to think about that &ndash; that so much of the modern discipline of HCI and interaction design grew up from roots in getting computers to understand and communicate in natural language. It makes total sense, of course &ndash; that the same people who were trying to figure out how to get computers to understand how to interact with us are the people now trying to build more effective interfaces &ndash; the interfaces have just changed.</p>
<p>The line up of speakers was incredible &ndash; sort of a historical trip from then until now &ndash; here are a few:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I started my own interest in HCI in about 1991, when the work was just starting to be oriented around design thinking (Bill Verplank from PARC, IDEO and Interval) and anthropology. The program had just started; I was probably a sophomore or junior at the time, and a senior friend of mine named Sean White kept telling me that I should look into it, that I would like it a lot. I kept brushing him off &ndash; I thought my path was going to be in (what I thought was the significantly more technical and higher impact world of) computer architecture design (RISC is the future!).</p>
<p>There were two events that were pivotal for me (beyond Sean&rsquo;s good-natured prodding). [and a short aside here is in order &ndash; not only did Sean affect what my course of study would be, but about a decade later, having not been in touch for many years, out of the blue Sean sent an e-mail introducing me to someone named Reid Hoffman, then an exec at PayPal. No agenda, no motive, the note just said that he thought we might like knowing each other. That was the start for what&rsquo;s turned into an exceptionally productive relationship &ndash; Sean profoundly affected my life a 2nd time!] But back to this story&hellip;</p>
<p>The first pivotal event was an internship I had at Sun Microsystems, working on graphics hardware. At the time it was obvious that Silicon Graphics was the important competitor and that hardware architecture was the important thing to work on. (Note to self: what seems completely, totally obvious today often seems pretty ridiculous in hindsight.) But fortunately that was a time when Scott McNealy was CEO and he really opened up the place to interns &ndash; he really encouraged us to poke around inside Sun, to talk with interesting people, and to generally make nuisances of ourselves. One of the guys I&rsquo;m sure I annoyed was Bob Glass, a UI designer nicknamed &ldquo;Dr. Bob&rdquo; who had come to Sun from Apple to &ldquo;drain the swamp or pave it over&rdquo; &ndash; talking about the crappy UIs that Unix always had (especially) compared to Apple. Clearly, he didn&rsquo;t really win that particular battle, but he framed an important problem for me as we talked in his office. He said this: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Who cares how fast the architecture is if nobody uses it?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That single question, quite literally, changed my life.</p>
<p>I finally started to understand what Sean White had been saying all along, and started looking seriously into pursing HCI at Stanford. The second pivotal moment for me came shortly after, when I read an essay by Mitch Kapor making the case for software design as a profession.</p>
<p>After that series of events, I was pretty well hooked, and dove into learning everything I could about how to design systems that people actually wanted to use; software that made people&rsquo;s lives better. I started working on my master&rsquo;s degree at Stanford with Professor Winograd as my advisor.</p>
<p>There were only 2 courses in the curriculum at the time: CS247A, something like fundamentals of HCI, taught by Bill Verplank, and CS247B, something like using anthropological techniques to do needfinding, taught by someone who I remembered liking a LOT, but who I can&rsquo;t recall anymore.</p>
<p>At that point, I became the Annoying Junior Design Guy, quoting a (complaining) Don Norman all the time, asking everyone why the clocks on their VCRs and microwaves were always blinking &ldquo;12:00&rdquo; and generally just bitching about how badly designed the world was. I&rsquo;m sure I was a real treat to be around. But then I got involved in a few more classes that I just really loved.</p>
<p>CS447, taught by Terry Winograd and David Kelley, was a design lab affiliated with the then-annual Apple Design Competition &ndash; I learned a lot about how hard it is to actually make things that don&rsquo;t suck. (Which, happily for everyone, subsequently reduced the amount of complaining about bad design that I did.)</p>
<p>I remember taking a class on Filmcraft in User Interface Design that pretty much blew my mind. The instructors of that class were Chuck Clanton and Emilie Young from First Person, a Sun spinout building a set top box that would fail, but would ultimately be the foundations of the Java programming language. They were really pioneers in thinking about how to use animation in computer interfaces &ndash; very early forerunners of the physics in the UI of today&rsquo;s iPhones.</p>
<p>Many foundational elements were put in place by Professor Winograd and friends in the early nineties &ndash; but I think that maybe the most important was getting the IDEO folks, and David Kelley in particular, involved. It brought a human-centeredness to the work that we did and that Stanford taught, and a religion around iteration that has served the program well since, and paved the way for a lot of what the Stanford d.School is today. Winograd did all this stuff at a time when, especially among &ldquo;proper&rdquo; computer scientists it wasn&rsquo;t very fashionable &ndash; but he had conviction and passion around the work &ndash; and of course he was right to.</p>
<p>From the vantage point of 2011, it&rsquo;s clear that the work done by Winograd and the rest of the growing HCI group there is important and has had a large impact on creating thoughtful designers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very, very clear that our educational system hasn&rsquo;t produced nearly enough good designers who are technical enough and talented enough to build all the great products and companies that Silicon Valley (and the world) are trying to build. That&rsquo;s not particularly an indictment of the educational system &ndash; we&rsquo;re in a golden age of technology development &ndash; a sort of New Cambrian Age of personal digital life. There are so many new things to build, so many new areas of communication to explore and create, so many new interactions to create from whole cloth &ndash; as a society and as an industry, we&rsquo;re going to have an insatiable appetite for great designers certainly for the coming decades.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a time now when everything&rsquo;s changing; everything is up for grabs. I&rsquo;m just incredibly glad that Professor Winograd and his colleagues had the foresight to set the foundations that we&rsquo;re building on so quickly today. And personally grateful for Sean White pushing me to notice the things that were happening right under my nose.</p>

			 <p>I tweeted over the weekend that we learned last week that SPL was accepted into the Mandarin Immersion program at Ohlone Elementary School for next year. It&rsquo;s a huge development for us &ndash; it&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why we moved to Palo Alto a few months ago<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and something we didn&rsquo;t really expect to happen, given that the odds were stacked against.</p>
<p>So we were pretty overjoyed about it, and still are. Of course, like in any endeavor, you celebrate and move on, and now we&rsquo;re puzzling over any number of implications and next steps.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve been talking about it with other parents, everyone has been hugely supportive and congratulatory, and ask how we&rsquo;re feeling about it. And as we&rsquo;ve been answering, what&rsquo;s become clear to me is this: parenting is a series of decisions that could have profound implications years from now that you have no way of really, truly understanding now. There&rsquo;s an unfortunate lack of data on what works in education generally, let alone in language immersion programs.</p>
<p>(Although it&rsquo;s important to say this: we know a LOT more about what works in education than we actually use in practice. Lots and lots of reasons for this: many are industry structural, many are cultural &ndash; we have a lot to learn about best practices in teaching still, in a data-and-outcome-oriented way &ndash; but it would be a big step to be able to use what we DO know.)</p>
<p>In the case of SPL and Mandarin, we really are excited about it, and SPL is, too. But it&rsquo;s very hard to tell what it will mean in the long term. It&rsquo;s been really clear so far that learning Chinese and English at the same time (since he was about 3) has been challenging, and that it&rsquo;s affected the order of his skill development (in particular in terms of reading and writing, since he&rsquo;s learning a couple of very different systems simultaneously). There&rsquo;s some new research that suggests that in general, dual-language learners develop more slowly in terms of reading &amp; writing until about 4th grade, at which point they catch up and develop normally. There&rsquo;s other literature that suggests that kids who grow up bilingual have better executive function as adults, presumably because their brains become good at making snap decisions on which language to use in any given situation.</p>
<p>But in truth, who the hell knows? The data sets we have on this stuff are vanishingly small. As I wrote about Ohlone, in our experience there just aren&rsquo;t any other schools that are constructivist and whole child and Mandarin immersion &ndash; so the data we have to look at is really just the 4 classes that have come before us. So we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying we haven&rsquo;t worked the angles on this. Like so many of our friends, we can be a little, um&hellip;detail-obsessed and maybe even have OCD tendencies. And since Kathy&rsquo;s a teacher, you might imagine that we&rsquo;ve done a lot of thinking and talking about this with lots of friends and educators. And so we have good feelings about it, based on pretty good reasoning.</p>
<p>In that way, parenting is sort of like trying to operate a startup. You never have nearly the information you need to make decisions; and lots of times when you&rsquo;re trying to make certain decisions you not only don&rsquo;t even understand the implications of what you&rsquo;re deciding, but often don&rsquo;t even really understand the data that you think you do.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re off to the races. Will SPL embrace his Chinese over the years? Will he work in China 20 years from now? Will he reject it like so many kids reject piano lessons? How will it affect the way he thinks, the way he looks at the world, the way he makes his own way?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know &ndash; we&rsquo;ve really got no idea at all. But that&rsquo;s sort of the mystery and the magic of it. We&rsquo;ll learn as we go. Nobody&rsquo;s seen this particular movie before, and that&rsquo;ll make it challenging, and interesting, and human.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m at the airport waiting for my flight home from TED 2011, my third trip to TED. TED is an amazing conference and community - every time I&rsquo;ve been it&rsquo;s been different but also a little bit the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the videos for several years, of course - they&rsquo;re a monumental source of inspiration and erudition and passion and intellect - not to mention sort of a master&rsquo;s class in presentation skills. So when I was able to attend for the first time in 2009, it was a little mind blowing. I was overwhelmed with everything. The content, the experience, the caliber of attendees, everything. Browsing the bookstore with Peter Gabriel. Sitting behind Paul Simon for one of the sessions. Using a urinal next to Bill Gates. (it seemed notable at the time. Now not so much.) Everything was overwhelming. I spent the week just soaking it all up, attending most every presentation and just loving it all.</p>
<p>My second time, in 2010, was really different. I had decided I was going to leave Mozilla, and so a lot of what I was starting to work on was figuring out how to make that happen in the best possible way. That meant I was working more - doing email, talking with people to brainstorm about potential candidates, etc. TED is structured physically in a really interesting way - there&rsquo;s the main auditorium where many people watch the talks, but there are also many spaces around the auditorium and even in tents outside where the talks are simulcast and provide spaces to work without bothering other audience members. It&rsquo;s a way to watch but with a little less investment; it&rsquo;s also a way to be more social as you process the content. And of course it&rsquo;s a way to watch with friends. So I didn&rsquo;t connect with as much of the speaker content then as I had the previous year, but a couple of talks were revelatory, and I noted a bunch of them to watch later (which I did for the most part.)</p>
<p>This year felt different yet again. It was my first time here that I felt, more than anything, like it was a gathering of my community, of my friends, and I felt like part of it, rather than attending a conference. I happened to know a few of the speakers and got to talk with them both before and after their talks. Instead of just being excited to be around folks, I got into really, really interesting conversations with them about areas of their expertise, of my expertise, and then a bunch of areas where none of us knew much of anything. (I felt particularly lucky to spend time with Mohamed Nanabhay head of Al Jazeera English online - and to hear him talk about what it was like in the Doha newsroom when Mubarak left. Inspiring.) Like last year, though, I worked quite a bit, whether it was talking with other technologists and investors or paying attention to my e-mail. As a result, I again felt a little distanced from the content unfortunately, except for a few of the sessions. That&rsquo;s something I plan to change next year - I&rsquo;ll still have plenty of work to do, but I&rsquo;m going to work hard to make sure that when I&rsquo;m around the presentations that I let myself engage, focus, and let the content surround me more.</p>
<p>Even so, TED has a way of sneaking up on you, and the last day was tremendously inspiring. Was great to hear Jack Horner talking about building dinosaurs out of chickens (and I&rsquo;m excited to visit him in Montana this summer). Was amazing to hear General McChrystal talk about leadership, and Kathryn Schulz talk about being wrong. But the last two talks were the gems for me. John Hunter, a 4th grade teacher from Virginia got up to talk about his &ldquo;Peace Game,&rdquo; which he&rsquo;s been using to teach for 30 years. (there&rsquo;s a documentary about him called World Peace and other 4th Grade Accomplishments). Hard to summarize, but take my word for it: watch it when it&rsquo;s released online. We need more teachers like John getting their voices heard by folks more often. It&rsquo;s very very easy to be discouraged and cynical about the state of education today - I often am myself - but that glosses over the fact that there are thousands - tens of thousands - of minor miracles happening every day in our classrooms. There are thousands of incredible, inspirational, talented teachers who are helping our kids understand, and build, and become. The system is busted, sure. But there are teachers like John who are revelatory, and they should get more chances for their voices to be heard and inspire us all.</p>
<p>The conference finished up with a Roger Ebert, who talked quite literally, about losing his own voice and finding it again. As he noted himself, it&rsquo;s a little tough to look at him - he lost his jaw to cancer several years ago, nearly died several times, and can no longer eat, drink or speak. But the guy has always been an incredible communicator, and still is. When they were setting up for his talk, they put 4 chairs on stage, which had me scratching my head. He came in and sat down and (of course) played a movie clip from 2001 of HAL being shut down. Then 3 people joined him: his wife, Dean Ornish, and John Hunter (who I mentioned above). And they brought out his MacBook for him. He used the voice synthesizer on his laptop to start his talk - and he provided a sort of narration on top by using his (very expressive) facial expressions as an accompaniment. Then, as he noted that synthesized voices tend to put people to sleep, he had his wife, Dean, and John each read parts of his talk for him, again, adding his own visual expressions as they went. The talk was about, in the main, his journey of losing his voice to using technology like voice synthesis and blogs and Twitter to find it again. It was a wonderful meditation on what it means to literally lose your voice, and to look disabled but not to think that way. The most emotional part of the week was experiencing his wife reading his words about how others see him now, disfigured, and the assumptions that he sees them make. She had to pause for part &ndash; it was the most amazing thing to watch. Because Roger had written very matter-of-fact words about how people perceive him present state - they assume he&rsquo;s broken in other ways - and he seems to have come to peace with it. But watching the emotion from his wife as she tried to read those words - what was incredibly, incredibly clear is that she doesn&rsquo;t seem him in that way at all, doesn&rsquo;t think that others do, that she hurts that he feels this way about his relationship to the world, whether he&rsquo;s at peace with it or not. And mostly that she just really loves him in a profound way. It was a beautiful, touching thing to experience - I was pretty much a wreck, and I&rsquo;m sure that most everyone in attendance was.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing about TED. Every time I go, there are at least a couple of experiences that I have that change the way that I look at the world, the way that I want to be when I go home. TED makes you want to be better, smarter, more present, more thoughtful, more impactful, more human. To be a better citizen and a better professional and a better dad and a better husband and a better friend. That type of inspiration doesn&rsquo;t happen all that much, and it&rsquo;s worth the price of admission every time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why June Cohen and Tom Rielly, on the TED team are two of my true heroes. They both have chosen to spend their lives working on building up TED outside of just the week of the conference every year. Tom has built the TED Fellows program, which started out pretty damn great and at this point is starting to move into basically ass-kicking-terrifyingly-awesome territory. And June, who put TED Talks online for everyone to see, including subtitling into 80+ languages.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is how you change the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you take this beautiful, wonderful experience for a few people in California each year and turn it into something that anyone &ndash; anyone! &ndash; can use to make themselves, their community, their world better themselves.</p>

			 <p>In today&rsquo;s New York Times Business Section, there&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->piece on the current state of work life balance<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in an age of iPhones and Twitter (more or less). I&rsquo;m quoted in it a little bit, so figured I would write some about the conversation I had with the writer and some thoughts that didn&rsquo;t make it into the piece.</p>
<p>I talked with Mickey (the author) while I was taking time off between Mozilla and Greylock, right after I had written <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this blog post on disconnecting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I got connected to her via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bob Sutton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who&rsquo;s in the article as well, and who&rsquo;s always thoughtful and very quotable. Before I took off for vacation, my partner David Sze suggested to me that I totally disconnect from everything, saying that I would find the silence precious. He was right, for sure &ndash; but I just couldn&rsquo;t really figure out how to do it. Too much of my life now is tangled up in e-mail, Twitter, Facebook, others. I think of myself as essentially an introvert, but I get a lot out of having the social connectivity that I do online. It&rsquo;s all just become a part of my life that is very, very hard to turn off &ndash; it&rsquo;s a little bit like turning off &ldquo;talking to the neighbors,&rdquo; at least for me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really tell you if this is good, bad or indifferent &ndash; it is what it is. It does feel different than even a couple of years ago. As I mentioned in the article, it&rsquo;s become a sort of &ldquo;peripheral vision&rdquo; &ndash; I can generally keep track of how people I care about and work with are feeling by reading what they tweet about and share on Facebook. How much they&rsquo;re sharing is pertinent, too &ndash; you can sort of see some of the ebbs and flows of peoples' lives.</p>
<p>One of the things that didn&rsquo;t make it into the article is that I found engaging on Twitter indispensable for managing effectively at Mozilla. Hewlett &amp; Packard used to talk about &ldquo;managing by walking around&rdquo; &ndash; the idea that the best way to understand what&rsquo;s happening in an organization is just to walk around and observe it yourself. To meet people where they work, to talk with them about whatever is on their mind, to ask lots of questions. I really, really believe in doing that &ndash; more than being useful, I just really enjoyed doing it.</p>
<p>With so many Mozillians distributed around the world, living in Twitter became a modern sort of walking around for me. I followed and interacted with dozens of folks this way over the last couple of years. Clearly, not everyone was there &ndash; and we have a couple of other online forums that are probably even more important (IRC &amp; Bugzilla) &ndash; but many were. And it was a great way to understand what was top of mind for folks, to understand who was feeling discouraged, who was feeling ready for new things. And just to commune with each other, really. I learned a lot by thinking about it that way.</p>
<p>Mozilla is unusual in its openness, so it&rsquo;s hard for me to completely generalize from that experience &ndash; because of the open product roadmap and the open community involvement, doing all this stuff on the public internet was pretty natural. Obviously many (most?) companies won&rsquo;t be able to do it quite like this. Conversely, I don&rsquo;t think the closed, enterprise-only systems like Jive, Yammer &amp; others are as diverse and rich in information (although they&rsquo;re very clearly useful and will be successful). But as organizations become more agile, more distributed, more mixed in with other organizations in their processes and workforces, I think we&rsquo;ll start to see tools that enable this peripheral vision or managing by walking around across boundaries that used to be more distinct.</p>
<p>Anyway, as to the main point of the article, I obviously haven&rsquo;t really done much disconnecting at all. It was nice to try for a few days, but also felt like a lot of life was missing. For good or bad, for better or worse &ndash; this is life and work in modern times. We&rsquo;re all learning together how to make sense of ubiquitous connectivity, of persistent projections of ourselves online, and the tensions between our physical world and our increasingly meaningful virtual one.</p>

		<a href="https://johnolilly.com/2011/02/05/social-artifacts.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-02-06 01:48:50 &#43;0700">Feb 6, 2011</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One more post that&rsquo;s (somewhat) related to books and that&rsquo;s it for the morning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rise of eBooks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->disappearance of physical books from our home<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and other spaces before; as I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;m worried that we&rsquo;re losing some of the manifestations-in-the-real-world of our personalities &ndash; signals to ourselves and to others about who we are, what we care about, and what our values are. You might call the general category Social Artifacts or Cultural Artifacts.</p>
<p>Social artifacts are everywhere you look, of course. They&rsquo;re the items we put on our desks, the pictures we put on our walls, the clothes we wear, the vehicles we ride in, etc etc. Lots of items we have in our lives show implicit values.</p>
<p>[aside: There is, for sure, a difference between what we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->imply <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by the choices we make and what others <!-- raw HTML omitted -->infer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about us. I&rsquo;m glossing over that distinction a bit, but maybe will come back to it.]</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why books do such a good job of communicating values, though: there are a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of choices, and they&rsquo;re deep choices. While it&rsquo;s likely that I might love a few books that are the same as the ones that you really love &ndash; but there&rsquo;s just about no chance that in a collection of 20 or 30 that we&rsquo;d have the same set. And so there&rsquo;s a richness in the information you get from seeing what books someone has in their house, or that they&rsquo;re carrying around to read on their lunch breaks over time. With books disappearing from our public and private spaces (we can argue about the pace that it&rsquo;s happening at, I think, but not about whether it&rsquo;s starting), we&rsquo;re seeing different types of signals, but I think they&rsquo;re more generic. What clothes you wear, what furniture you like, what smart phone you use. (Which, I have to say, is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bizarre <!-- raw HTML omitted -->social signal. We are not our computers.)</p>
<p>More and more of these social artifacts are virtual, absolutely, and there&rsquo;s infinite richness there. But it&rsquo;s pretty uneven. For some people, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to see their collection of social artifacts because they&rsquo;ve lived online for a long time and have often curated them. Joi Ito probably has the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clearest set of signals<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and he&rsquo;s been working on that for years. Myself, I&rsquo;m relatively knowable, between my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tweets<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc etc. I&rsquo;ve been playing this week with my profile on Shelfari, too &ndash; it&rsquo;s now got my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->15 year media purchase history from Amazon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on it &ndash; but it isn&rsquo;t really right. It&rsquo;s taking my old, physical artifacts and grafting them onto the virtual world.</p>
<p>But for people who aren&rsquo;t wired a little funny like Joi or me, sometimes it can be hard to see their social artifacts spread around the web. Lots are in Facebook &amp; Twitter. For some people, lots are in Flickr.</p>
<p>Anyway, no real conclusions here. Like every generation, the next generation will find their own ways to express themselves and to interpret others. I think while we&rsquo;re in the midst of this transition towards more of our lives happening in the ether, we&rsquo;ll see lots of weird juxtapositions like Shelfari showing collections on screens around the house, and they&rsquo;ll always look a bit like misfits.</p>
<p>So I guess my takeaway here, in this post that&rsquo;s a little all over the place, is that I&rsquo;ll miss books as communicators of personality and values, but am on the lookout for emerging systems and am really, really interested in how we&rsquo;ll all use them.</p>

			 <p>Last week I got to attend a class at Stanford Business School taught by one of my favorites, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Huggy Rao<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The course is on &ldquo;scaling&rdquo; &ndash; an over-used word, but one that Huggy&rsquo;s been really digging into lately &ndash; resulting in some great insights. This particular class covered a case study authored by Huggy with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bob Sutton<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the rise of Mozilla and Firefox, so it was fun to participate in.</p>
<p>Huggy asked me to do a quick 10 minute introduction to the class. I chose to talk about the differences between then and now &ndash; how much has changed in the 5.5 years since Firefox&rsquo;s initial 1.0, and what the new challenges of scaling are. So, naturally, my first comment to the students was that most of the case was irrelevant to today&rsquo;s world. That Mozilla was amazing and unique and special &ndash; for lots of reasons that include (1) breaking the MS/IE monopoly distribution and usage of the browser, (2) doing it in a way that enabled lots of innovation and competition that we&rsquo;re seeing now, and (3) finding our own way through the journey &ndash; not behaving like anyone else in the market ever really has. So that&rsquo;s cool. In that battle, though, access to users was probably the biggest challenge &ndash; it looked impossible when Mozilla started, and it&rsquo;s remarkable &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->incredible, really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; that we ultimately have gotten the reach we have.</p>
<p>But fast forward to today&rsquo;s world, where we have more than 600M users on Facebook, more than 400M users of Firefox, and networks like LinkedIn and Twitter with global reach of a hundred million or more. Combine that with the rise of the Apple App Store and mobile devices &ndash; with something approaching 200M user accounts that all have credit cards associated with them. (And if there&rsquo;s any doubt, these numbers are truly huge. I put in some cultural references in my talk &ndash; about 100M people will watch the SuperBowl. And only about 20M watch the nightly news in America; 30M listen to NPR. We think of these institutions as huge, but they&rsquo;re nowhere near Internet scale at this point. The new networks have left them behind, quite handily.)</p>
<p>So now a huge part of the world is accessible, a huge part of the world is ready and able to download an app or click on a shared link. Which means that access is no longer the chief initial obstacle to scaling. That means you can see companies like Zynga or Groupon rise from nothing to massive practically overnight. Clearly, the initial challenge is about rising above the noise of an increasingly crowded field of ways for people to spend their time and money, but it&rsquo;s very, very possible to get to tens or hundreds of millions of users quickly. Which means that now you&rsquo;ve got companies that are dealing with huge, complex, global user bases at an extremely early point in their history. My view is that scaling successfully &ndash; which means sustaining that scale over time &ndash; will be dependent on figuring out how to make the teams and processes in rocket ship organizations operate effectively.</p>
<p>I know not all the analogies in the slides are apples-to-apples, but what&rsquo;s clear is that we&rsquo;re living in an era of hyper-distribution, where things can change very, very quickly. I&rsquo;m really glad that smart people like Huggy and Bob are thinking about how to help us all learn how to manage these in the future.</p>
<p>Fun conversation, thanks to Huggy for the invitation! My few slides are below &ndash; they&rsquo;re very incomplete and mostly served to provoke some interesting discussion. (PS &ndash; the deck is sort of a tweener deck graphically between my Mozilla-style slides and what I&rsquo;ll use here at Greylock &ndash; haven&rsquo;t been here long enough to monkey with the Greylock slides yet. :-))</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a busy January for the companies I know the best &ndash; first TripIt was acquired by Concur and last week <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SayNow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> announced that it&rsquo;s been purchased by Google. I was a minor advisor to SayNow, and have been involved since the beginning &ndash; since before the beginning, really, and I could not be happier for Nikhyl &amp; Ujjwal &ndash; these two entrepreneurs deserve all the success and recognition they&rsquo;ve gotten and will get, and really deserve a lot more.</p>
<p>They started SayNow with a bunch of intuitions that voice communications were an undervalued and underused part of the web &ndash; it&rsquo;s obvious in hindsight, but they were quite early to that conclusion, nearly 5 years ago now. The road from insight to today was anything but obvious, though. Nik &amp; Ujjwal spent lots of time experimenting, building, listening &ndash; really trying to figure out how to make the most useful voice service they could.</p>
<p>What impressed me most about their journey is that they were very often working so hard without the adoration of the TechCrunches and GigaOms of the world &ndash; they were working on relatively unsexy problems that really mattered, but maybe weren&rsquo;t the most tweetable. They pivoted many times, they worked incredibly hard, and they just wouldn&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known Nikhyl pretty close to forever &ndash; probably since my second year at Stanford &ndash; and he&rsquo;s one of my very closest friends and confidants &ndash; we&rsquo;ve talked about so many challenges and successes over the years that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine my career (or life) without him. And I&rsquo;ve known Ujjwal since SayNow&rsquo;s founding, and always been blown away by his commitment, hard work, intelligence, friendliness, and ability to just get things done.</p>
<p>For the two of them and the whole SayNow team, I&rsquo;m incredibly, incredibly happy for them, and impressed by them, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what they do at Google.</p>

			 <p>This morning <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TripIt announced <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that it&rsquo;s signed an agreement to be acquired by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Concur<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a publicly traded travel &amp; expense company. It&rsquo;s a fantastic outcome for all involved, and I&rsquo;m very proud to have been involved as a member of the board of directors over the last several years.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s a great example of doing things right. It&rsquo;s an awesome team that made an awesome product that lots of people can&rsquo;t live without &ndash; simple as that.</p>
<p>I started using the product way before I got involved in the company. I can still remember waking up in Tokyo at 4a suffering from jet lag, going through my news feeds and noticing a financing round in 2008 that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mark and Bryce from OATV<!-- raw HTML omitted --> had participated in (they did the original round of financing in 2007 &ndash; great foresight!). I sent them a short note, saying something like: &ldquo;Awesome investment, it&rsquo;s a terrific product. Couldn&rsquo;t live without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That led to Mark introducing me to Gregg Brockway and Scott Hintz, the founders, and over time we developed a relationship that turned into an outside board seat for me. It has been a wonderful relationship. If you&rsquo;ve ever met Gregg and Scott, you know what I mean: they&rsquo;re extremely hard working, smart, humble, thoughtful founders &ndash; really everything you could ask for in a founding team. They&rsquo;re always ready and willing to engage on any aspect of the product or the business; they&rsquo;ve always put building a great business at the top of the list of concerns. I love working with both Gregg and Scott, full stop.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve put together a team that is like that as well. The developers, marketers, designers and other managers &ndash; everyone&rsquo;s been committed to building something great. (Andy Denmark, in particular, deserves an award for being patient with me as I nitpicked various things over the years &ndash; to his eternal credit, his response was always very positive.) And it includes the other members of the board as well &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mark Jacobsen from OATV<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mike Kwatinetz from Azure<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; they&rsquo;ve been amazing and fun to work with, and I can&rsquo;t imagine the past several months working with anyone else.</p>
<p>So I wanted to say thank to you the whole team &ndash; it&rsquo;s been deeply gratifying to be involved, and I know you&rsquo;ll continue to do amazing things with a bigger platform like Concur. To my mind, it&rsquo;s a testament to doing things the right way, and to building products people love.</p>
<p>Onward and congratulations!</p>

			 <p>As part of the move to a new house, we&rsquo;ve got about thirty boxes of books in the basement right now; everything we had, boxed up. That&rsquo;s maybe 1,000 or 1,500 books; and that&rsquo;s after we gave away a few hundred each year to the Sunnyvale Library. Lots of books. And they&rsquo;re heavy.</p>
<p>I used to think that I really loved books &ndash; with the advent of the Kindle and iPad, what I&rsquo;ve discovered is that it&rsquo;s not so much the books that I loved as the reading. So my relationship with books is changing.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I really like the physical reminders of what I&rsquo;ve read and the works that have most meaningfully shaped my thinking over the years. It&rsquo;s neat to walk by a bookshelf and have the spines of the books remind me of my UX work in school, or my interest in various histories, or even some of the fiction I read when I was a kid. And I like that other people can get a glimpse into my background that way, not to mention that it&rsquo;s always great to hand someone a book after a dinner together. (Increasingly, as SPL gets older and able to read, I&rsquo;m hoping to share some of my favorite books from childhood, too.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, they&rsquo;re heavy. And a hassle to move around. And they take a lot of space. And when they&rsquo;re in my bookshelves, they&rsquo;re not really very useful to people who haven&rsquo;t read them yet, like they might be if they lived in a library instead.</p>
<p>And, increasingly, they&rsquo;re showing an out-of-date picture of what books &amp; writing influence me. The past 200 or so books I&rsquo;ve read have all been electronic (with maybe half a dozen exceptions), so the most contemporary view of what influences me is probably on my blog or my Kindle account. Not totally satisfying.</p>
<p>So as I unpack all the books (I saved them to the end, basically), I&rsquo;ve got to figure out what to do with them all. I&rsquo;m going to try to give away about half of them. We&rsquo;ll see how I do on that, but I figure they&rsquo;ll do more people more good if we give them to a library.</p>
<p>As I go box by box, though, I&rsquo;m realizing that I have no good mental model on which books to keep and which to get rid of. Keep all the coffee table books? Get rid of all the random history books? Keep books by people I know? Get rid of things that are mostly text, better to read by Kindle? Keep things that SPL might like as a kid? I don&rsquo;t really know, and it&rsquo;s interesting emotionally.</p>
<p>So far, though, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m keeping:</p>

			 <p>Each year I look back on the books I&rsquo;ve read and highlight a few of my favorites. Looking back on 2010, it looks like I read fewer books than in the previous years, and was less excited about the ones I did read. Not sure I read any truly great books this year. (Although I did read a truly horrible book, from one of my favorite authors, Jonathan Lethem: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chronic City<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)</p>
<p>All that said, here are the books I read in 2010 for the first time that I liked best:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too Big to Fail<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Andrew Sorkin &ndash; great, detailed account of the meltdown of the financial sector. I think not as readable as Michael Lewis' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Big Short, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->which I&rsquo;m in the middle of, but very interesting.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Windup Girl<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by Paolo Bacigalupi &ndash; great, original science fiction of a very believable and bleak future. Wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but very good.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Room<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very hard book to read, but probably the most original, thoughtful voice in fiction I read this year. On a lot of folks' Top of 2010 lists.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Four Fish<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by Paul Greenberg &ndash; a detailed look at human relationships with the four main types of fish we consume voraciously. Everyone should read this one.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Hunger Games Trilogy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by Suzanne Collins &ndash; a really terrific young adult series that I devoured in about a week. Reminded me a lot of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Running Man, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and was extremely readable.</p>
<p>So those are my five for 2010. (What were yours??) Looking forward to great stuff in 2011. :-)</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a very busy past 45 days or so. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about changes &amp; choices &ndash; and have a blog post brewing about that, maybe for later this week.</p>
<p>But right now, I&rsquo;m trying to slow down my own clock speed, take my time, try to be a little more generative, to think bigger, more original thoughts. The last few years have been very operational &ndash; lots and lots of details, very quick pacing &ndash; it&rsquo;s time for me to slow down, get a bigger framing. I&rsquo;ve been taking some time off between Mozilla and Greylock &ndash; but it&rsquo;s been the busiest time off I can ever remember. Moving out of our old house, getting it ready to sell; moving into our new house; having lots of family here for the holidays, on and on. Lots of motion lately.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s the first day I really feel like I&rsquo;m on break &ndash; nothing more scheduled than a little puttering around the house, going for a run in a bit, and generally getting ready to watch the Orange Bowl tonight. I&rsquo;m going to also try turning off my Google Reader and Twitter &amp; Facebook checking for a week or two, also. I&rsquo;ve got two weeks more at home, then really start my time at Greylock in earnest. In that time period, I also turn 40, an arbitrary milestone, to be sure, but something to reflect on.</p>
<p>We live in very, very, very interesting times. More things are changing, quickly, about how we live our lives and interact with each other than I&rsquo;ve ever experienced in my life. It&rsquo;s a time of incredible, incredible opportunity (and one of very significant social and technical challenges, for sure). I&rsquo;m really excited to have a bit of time to start 2011 to slow down, try to think longer term, and to slow down my clock.</p>
<p>Happy 2011!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m late in posting this, but wanted to write something about a tour I was involved in a couple of weeks ago: Silicon Valley comes to the UK (SVc2UK), and SIlicon Valley Comes to Cambridge (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->SVC2C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), along with an additional trip to Silicon Valley Comes to Oxford, although I didn&rsquo;t go on the Oxford portion.</p>
<p>It was a really fantastic trip, organized by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sherry Coutu<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Reid Hoffman, and it was absolutely packed with interesting events and people.</p>
<p>The crew from Silicon Valley (which generously roped in folks from Vancouver, Washington &amp; NYC as well) was a great group &ndash; interesting and diverse &ndash; and interested and curious about each other and the technology landscape globally, and specifically in the UK. It included senior people/founders/chairs from Kiva, LinkedIn, Facebook, Google, oPower, Mozilla, Creative Commons, DoSomething.org, as well as investors from August, Index, and Greylock and more &ndash; very broad.</p>
<p>But the stars of the tour were the people we got to meet. During the 4 days, we had 23 events scheduled that reached <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2,700 people<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The first day we started in London talking with people who run the UK government at the House of Commons &ndash; we had several MPs in attendance, and were hosted by the Speaker of the House of Commons in the fantastic Speaker&rsquo;s Chambers. A few of us got to give short prepared remarks at the beginning of the session; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mine are here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>After that, we were hosted by Google to talk with entrepreneurs from around London, also a great session, and had an interesting dinner with more folks from the London startup scene in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BT Tower<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The second day, hosted by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NESTA<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we got to meet many first time London entrepreneurs and it was a great, great time. There&rsquo;s clearly a ton of interesting and fast startup activity happening in the UK currently, and it was neat to have a firsthand look into it. Was also fun to share some of our own experiences from Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>After that we hopped on a bus to go to Cambridge, which was an altogether different experience &ndash; also fantastic.</p>
<p>First a bit of history: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cambridge University<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was first established in 1284, and counts a number of incredible thinkers amongst its alumni: Isaac Newton, Francis Bacon, James Clerk Maxwell, Crick and Watson and many, many more. And it&rsquo;s been the home of seminal computer breakthroughs &ndash; it&rsquo;s where Charles Babbage and Alan Turing did their work.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, it&rsquo;s also had an incredible run in terms of tech industry output, including being the birthplace of ARM Holdings as well as Autonomy.</p>
<p>We spent Friday at the Judge Business School at Cambridge, in a variety of panels, talks, and &ldquo;surgeries&rdquo; helping new startups think through their strategies and priorities. The high point for me, I think, was being able to talk with the 3 recent winners of a national entpreneurship contest &ndash; 3 teenage girls who&rsquo;ve started their own venture. Great to be able to meet them and talk for a bit.</p>
<p>Saturday we spent time at the Hauser Center talking with a ton of interesting startups, and helping where we could.</p>
<p>Then we caught our breath for a bit. :-)</p>
<p>On each of the three nights in Cambridge, we were very fortunate to be able to have dinner in one of the colleges: Queens (shown in my picture above), Peterhouse (the oldest), and St. John&rsquo;s. One of the unexpected delights for me was that we were able to attend Choral Evensong in The Chapel of St John&rsquo;s College on Saturday night &ndash; it&rsquo;s a liturgy that&rsquo;s been sung in that particular chapel since the 1670s. It was amazing for me to be able to attend that &ndash; as an adult, I haven&rsquo;t been to church with any regularity, but I attended Methodist and Presbyterian churches growing up, and Dad has sung in choirs everywhere we&rsquo;ve gone (and still does). It reminded me of listening to some of that music growing up, but the other reason that I liked it (other than that the music was exceedingly beautiful) is that it&rsquo;s in such contrast to the hyper-paced, global, 24/7, always connected, media slammed life that we all live today. It allowed me to pause a bit, to reflect on what it means to be devoted to a cause, to spend your life trying to express ideas (in music or otherwise), and to think about things larger than just what products are released today that we can buy each other for Christmas. I doubt that I&rsquo;ll ever be a particularly religious person again in my life, but I felt very lucky to be able to attend Evensong and think some about perspective and pacing and commitment.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was an incredible trip &ndash; Sherry and Reid did a masterful job in putting it all together &ndash; it was a little overwhelming, to be honest. There are some great things happening in London and Cambridge, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see where they go.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve always been bad at leaving.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s my last day at Mozilla (as a full time employee &ndash; I&rsquo;ll continue to be on the Board of Directors), so I wanted to write down a bit of what I&rsquo;m feeling as I get ready to go in to work. I&rsquo;m writing this partly so that I can remember what it feels like &ndash; I&rsquo;m finding that it&rsquo;s quite an emotional time for me &ndash; and partly because I haven&rsquo;t seen much like this around the web, on other people&rsquo;s blogs.</p>
<p>Schrep likes to joke that of all job skills, I&rsquo;m worst at quitting, and he always feels bad when he makes that joke, but he&rsquo;s absolutely right, of course. It takes me a long time to transition. At Reactivity, I transitioned out over 4 months at the end of 2004; at Mozilla, it&rsquo;s been very nearly a year since I first talked with Mitchell about moving on.</p>
<p>There are reasons for that, of course &ndash; it took a bit of time to organize our plans and the organization to be able to get through a transition, and we did a retained search in a relatively speedy 5 1/2 months.</p>
<p>But for me it was a basic equation: I really, really care about Mozilla, and, given the context that I was ready to move to my next thing, I wanted to do whatever I could to make sure that we&rsquo;d get through the transition stronger than ever. I&rsquo;ve been extremely fortunate to have the support and patience of both Mozilla and Greylock during this period &ndash; and it&rsquo;s let us change in a way that I think has been very stable and should be good for the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already obvious that Gary&rsquo;s going to be an ouststanding CEO and team member for Mozilla &ndash; he&rsquo;s already a great culture fit, asking questions that cut to the heart of things, and providing clear insights. He&rsquo;s going to be great. Firefox 4, which is right around the corner, is an incredibly terrific product, both on desktop and mobile, that I think it validates our slow transition approach for the year. And we&rsquo;ve got so many things coming from our product groups and labs that I&rsquo;m certain next year will be transformative for the project, the organization, and the whole web.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, hiring a replacement for yourself is a particularly self-centered and self-reflective experience. For me, it caused me to spend a lot of time thinking about what I did well, what I screwed up, how the organization had changed over the years, how I&rsquo;d changed over the years. It&rsquo;s taught me a bunch about myself and what I care about, and how I want to live my work life in the future.</p>
<p>I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote about leaving<!-- raw HTML omitted --> back when we first announced the CEO search, and all of that is even truer now. I&rsquo;m proud of what we&rsquo;ve done together at Mozilla, proud of how we&rsquo;ve changed the world. I&rsquo;ve got a deep gratitude to the whole community that let me come in and gave me the support to make my own mark on the project. And I&rsquo;m really, really excited to watch the whole project change the world in new and amazing ways in the years to come.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m currently in the middle of an extremely interesting trip called Silicon Valley Comes to the UK, which Sherri Coutou and Reid Hoffman have organized for several years. it&rsquo;s a fantastic trip so far, and I&rsquo;ll write more about it, but wanted to share this.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yesterday we were invited to the House of Commons here in London, and after a short speech by the Speaker of the House of Commons, 5 of us participated in a panel on the impact of digital technology on the future of democracies. About 100 people attended, including several MPs and members of the House of Lords, plus people involved in running the government and figuring out what to do with technology.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was moderated by Jon Drori (fantastic job, and fantastic guy), and the Silicon Valley folks who participated were: Reid Hoffman, Megan Smith, Joi Ito, Nancy Lublin and myself. Each of the 5 of us started by giving a 5 minute &lsquo;provocation&rsquo; to consider, then we ran it as a more traditional panel.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ll write more soon; for now, my provocation follows. Would love to hear what you think. :-)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&mdash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I started preparing my remarks, I knew that I wanted to talk, in the main, about how technology can make our democracies better. But here, in the heart of British government, it&rsquo;s impossible for me not to think about a couple of British authors and imaginers of future dystopias: George Orwell and Aldous Huxley.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>With these 2 especially, it seems a particular talent of the British to imagine horrible dysfunctional futures. Orwell in his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1984,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of course, with nightmares of totalitarian control and surveillance, and oppressive government imposed on unwilling citizens. Huxley, by contrast, in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brave New World,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> painted a completely different picture: a citizenry of sheep happily gorging themselves on the trivial, on entertainment &ndash; with no Orwellian Ministry of Information needed at all.</p>
<p>In a book called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amusing Ourselves to Death<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an American named Neil Postman figured out nearly 30 years ago that what we were going to get wasn&rsquo;t Orwell&rsquo;s world at all, but rather a version of Huxley&rsquo;s. And while the British seem to be adept at imagining dystopias, I have to say that we Americans seem to be pretty handy at creating them. In the US now, we clearly live in Huxley&rsquo;s world: news has become entertainment; political discourse, when not an oxymoron, tends to be shallow. So many of the institutions and processes that have served us well for hundreds of years are breaking down.</p>
<p>Much of this is due to the nature of digital technology and the Internet, allowing massive amounts of new conversation, of news without context. The thing that digital technology is best at is closing gaps: in time, in space, in relevance &ndash; and that has put real stress on our institutions. Technology is not neutral &ndash; it makes many things easier, but also many things more difficult. There are winners and losers.</p>
<p>Clay Shirky, writing on the massive dislocations occurring today in the newspaper industry wrote: &ldquo;That is what real revolutions are like. The old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And things do feel broken today, in many ways &ndash; the forces of dystopia seem to be on the rise.
But even so, there is a lot &ndash; A LOT &ndash; to be optimistic about. The hints of a positive future show all around us. The seeds of utopia are in the ground, so to speak.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What we know from the work we&rsquo;ve done at Mozilla on Firefox and other open source projects, is that the way we organize, the technology we use, and the customs we support &ndash; what Tim O&rsquo;Reilly has called &ldquo;architectures of participation&rdquo; &ndash; matter greatly. Architectures of participation, like technologies themselves, aren&rsquo;t neutral. Projects like Wikipedia and Mozilla Firefox have architectures that are designed to bring in collaborators from everywhere, at every level. We have very serious contributors who spend most of their time working on the core. We have nearly 100 teams working on localizing Firefox into their own language. We have entrepreneurs building companies based on extensions to the browser. We have tens of thousands of people who test our browser each night and report issues. And we have hundreds of millions of users. We&rsquo;ve built architectures of participation to get people engaged in as many ways as we can.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the future utopia that&rsquo;s possible with digital technology? Ideally what we get &ndash; what we create &ndash; is a system where citizens are engaged, where they feel valued and connected with their governments and each other. Where our leaders are accountable &ndash; and desire to be accountable. It&rsquo;s a future where it&rsquo;s just as easy to help your neighborhood as it is to help your country or your planet.
To get there, we&rsquo;ll need to architect with a few key principles in mind:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made countless decisions in my career since first arriving at Stanford in 1989, but one of the top 5 specific decisions that I&rsquo;ve made was to become a section leader for introductory Computer Science classes at Stanford my sophomore year. I literally can&rsquo;t think of a single choice that&rsquo;s had farther reaching implications in my career. Some background is in order, I think.</p>
<p>The introductory CS classes at Stanford are called CS106A, CS106B, and CS106X &ndash; they&rsquo;re taught by lecturers (who, in my experience, were far &amp; away the most committed, thoughtful, caring, accessible, and, ultimately, impactful teachers at Stanford) and the class size was often large, anywhere from about 50 students up to 300 or so. The lecturers were supported by one TA, and a staff of &ldquo;section leaders&rdquo; &ndash; each an undergrad who was responsible for 6-10 students, would lead a weekly section, grade programs and generally give close attention to their group.</p>
<p>In any given quarter, there would be about 50 of these section leaders, as well as 2 &ldquo;CS198 Coordinators&rdquo; &ndash; these 2 were generally grad students, and they selected and hired new section leaders through an interview process and also taught a 1 quarter class on how to teach.  It&rsquo;s a great program, with a fantastic focus on peer teaching, and I think resulted in great results not only for the students taking the 106 courses, but also for the section leaders themselves.</p>
<p>I was turned down the first time I applied to be a section leader, but wanted to do it badly enough that I applied a 2nd time and was accepted. And eventually I was turned down <!-- raw HTML omitted -->twice <!-- raw HTML omitted -->when I applied to be coordinator, being accepted the third time around as a grad student. And that was probably my best experience at Stanford &ndash; well worth the feeling of getting turned down the first two times.</p>
<p>I think we knew, even then, that the program was incredible &ndash; that it selected amazing people and helped them develop in amazing ways &ndash; helped them learn CS at a deeper level, of course, but it was also shockingly effective at helping us all learn to teach and communicate &ndash; to really balance out the technical aspects of our education.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only with the benefit of hindsight that we can really see how incredible the program has been. The reason I&rsquo;m writing about it now is that a few weeks ago we had the first ever reunion in the 40 year history of the program, and it was just awesome. (You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read Eric&rsquo;s blog post and see his pics<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, too.) The make up of the attendees was a bit like a who&rsquo;s who list of Silicon Valley: startup founders, new CS professors, VPs of Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, CEOs, VCs, chief architects, researchers, and many others. The density and scope of achievement is really hard to describe, honestly. This program has had as much impact on Silicon Valley as any single program that I know of.</p>
<p>More personally, it reminded me of how many lasting, close friends that I developed there &ndash; most of my best friends went through the program at some point, and it was so good to see so many of them together.</p>
<p>I trust we won&rsquo;t wait another 40 years to have the 2nd reunion of the program &ndash; I&rsquo;m looking forward to having another one, soon.</p>

			 <p>In the next few weeks, we&rsquo;re planning to move from the house we&rsquo;ve lived in for 7 years in Sunnyvale, into a neighborhood in Palo Alto, motivated by a couple of public school options that we&rsquo;re really interested in as SPL approaches kindergarten age. So I was cleaning up the garage some this morning in preparation for that, and found myself thinking a lot about the endings and beginnings that are going on in our lives right now.</p>
<p>This week was essentially my last as CEO of Mozilla, and Gary&rsquo;s first week in that role. Today is the last day for the Green Gators U6 soccer team &ndash; SPL&rsquo;s as a player and mine as the coach &ndash; not as momentous, maybe, but a meaningful milestone &ndash; I think SPL and I each learned some things about each other and ourselves. And moving from the first house that Kathy &amp; I bought together, have lived in for 7 years &ndash; the only house and neighborhood that SPL has ever known &ndash; it&rsquo;s funny that I can still remember the day we brought him home, and how tiny he looked in his crib the first time.</p>
<p>And for me personally, this is the longest I&rsquo;ve ever lived in one house in my life. Since Dad was in the Air Force, we moved around a lot, living most places only 3 or 4 years. I&rsquo;ve lived in the Bay Area more or less continuously since I first arrived at Stanford in 1989 (except for 18 months in Austin and internships in Colorado Springs and Dallas), and this is without question my home. Our house in Sunnyvale is only about a third of that time overall, but a lot has happened here.</p>
<p>For other milestones, Kathy &amp; I both turn 40 in the coming months, too. Hard to really believe that.</p>
<p>So a few endings this month, and a few beginnings. They&rsquo;re happy remembrances &ndash; we&rsquo;ve been lucky to have wonderful neighbors, great teammates, fantastic co-workers, not to mention all our other friends, relatives, mentors.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not too worried about the endings that are coming &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to be able to maintain the important relationships in my life beyond the boundaries of a job or an apartment or a project, and figure that&rsquo;ll continue. It&rsquo;s hard work to maintain them &ndash; but it&rsquo;s these relationships that transcend boundaries of space, time, interest, convenience &ndash; that really make up our lives, isn&rsquo;t it? They give meaning to our lives with history and context, but also in creating a shared sense we have of tomorrow, and what comes next.</p>
<p>So onward, but with memories and some nostalgia, but also with connections.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m very happy to introduce Gary Kovacs as our new CEO for the Mozilla Corporation. I think he&rsquo;s going to be great for Mozilla, and that our broad community will like him and be well served by him.</p>
<p>This introduction is the culmination of a search process that&rsquo;s taken us about six months &ndash; we were quite broad in our search, as we knew it would be tough to find someone who could blend technology leadership and operational excellence with an ability to understand what&rsquo;s special about how Mozilla works, and who could really help develop the whole organization.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked with many people through this process &ndash; most of them were exceptionally talented in many ways. But Gary&rsquo;s a special person for the CEO role, and here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But beyond all that, it&rsquo;s his personality and humanity that really made us feel like he&rsquo;d be a great fit for Mozilla. He&rsquo;s a great communicator and a great listener. He understands that Mozilla is a unique organization, with unusual strengths and weaknesses, and really embraces that difference. But he&rsquo;s also ready and able to help us do more with what we&rsquo;ve built, and deliver even more towards Mozilla&rsquo;s mission of making the Web more participatory and more open.</p>
<p>Please join me in welcoming Gary to the global Mozilla community.</p>

			 <p>As I&rsquo;ve been writing lately, my grandmother Gigi died a couple of weeks ago - I&rsquo;m on a plane home now from her memorial service, which we held this weekend on St Simons Island, GA - she and the rest of Mom&rsquo;s family moved there in 1962 or 63, and she lived in the house that they built ever since.</p>
<p>It was a nice service, and nice weekend with my family - a group that I love and admire so much. Everyone who spoke about Gigi talked about her sense of humor, and her sharp tongue. And when the church pastor, during the homily for your funeral, mentions how sharp your sense of humor is, well, that&rsquo;s something distinctive. (He quoted Jack as saying, &ldquo;She could bury you with a single word.&quot;) Makes me smile to think of that - and I guess I know that I myself come by that particular character trait honestly.</p>
<p>And of course, books and Gigi reading them to kids, were featured prominently.</p>
<p>There were probably a couple hundred people there, from the island, from Brunswick, from Jacksonville and beyond. I think we had the service that she wanted. (And in fact, I know that we did, as she left extremely detailed instructions regarding, well, pretty much all the details. Also characteristic of her.)</p>
<p>And while only my brother David and I will really feel this, it&rsquo;ll always be hard to think of this weekend without thinking about another day in August in south Georgia when we buried my dad&rsquo;s father (Grandee is what we called him) 15 years ago.</p>
<p>The two experiences were incredibly different from each other - just as different as the two families are, really. Quitman, where Grandee lived most of his life and where my dad grew up, is a tiny, tiny town about 60 miles north of Tallahassee - and what I remember the most from those days was the funeral procession through the town, with the police at the intersections with their hats over their hearts, and then how impossibly light he was in the coffin was when we laid him to rest.</p>
<p>Gigi&rsquo;s service was very different, though - she was cremated a couple of weeks ago, and before the larger church service we had a very small gathering of just the family and the pastor to put her ashes in the memorial garden of the church. No body, no pall bearers like at Grandee&rsquo;s funeral, just us, with my uncles and brother putting her ashes into the garden. It was a good remembrance, and honored who she was.</p>
<p>What connects the two events most viscerally for me, other than the obvious relationship, is that I think I&rsquo;ll always remember how hot and humid it was both times - a characteristic Georgia heat that makes you sweat almost immediately when you step outside - and all of us in our ties and dresses and nice clothes.</p>
<p>Anyway, two completely different experiences, different families, separated by 15 years. But for my brother and me, these two August days will always be connected by the heat of the Georgia summer, and of remembering and honoring our grandparents.</p>

<p>As followers of my tweets know, I was really excited to see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rush<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in concert this week at Shoreline. Naturally, since the band is over 30 years old now, a bunch of people around work had no idea who they are. (And I got a bunch of questions like &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to see Rush Limbaugh?? Why??&quot;)</p>
<p>Anyway, the truth is, Rush is about my favorite band ever, and I could listen to them pretty much all day long, every day. They&rsquo;re the only band I can listen to and sing along to, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->while reading a book about something completely different. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The lyrics of their twenty-odd albums are that deep in my brain.</p>
<p>I think we all tend to be musical products of the years we were in high school, and more than any other bands, Rush and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->R.E.M.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were the definitive ones for me. R.E.M., of course, were the guys you wanted to be as cool as &ndash; they were hip, were talking about things that didn&rsquo;t really make sense to a teenager (or R.E.M. themselves, apparently, as Stipe later said he mostly made up the words because they sounded good).</p>
<p>Rush was different, though. They wrote music about things that mostly misfit males of my generation cared about. They struggled through Ayn Rand, wrote music about The Lord of the Rings, about science fiction. They worked through a lot of what then seemed like important existential questions, but now seem a little embarrassing to have struggled through in the first place. But in the middle 80s mostly what they wrote about was what it felt like being out of the mainstream &ndash; really, they sang about what it meant to be a nerd, and the things that nerds went through as they figured out how to become functioning parts of society.</p>
<p>I always felt like they were writing for me and people like me, and it really struck a chord. I loved the music, too &ndash; they wrote some of the most complex music of the times (ever?), with lots of moving time signatures, lots of unusual arrangements where the bass led, things like that. A lot of people have always been critical of the band for being a little too perfect, a little too soulless &ndash; in pursuit of technical perfection rather than connecting at an emotional level. (To make this article even nerdier than it already is (!), the claim is that they&rsquo;re sort of the rock band equivalent of the font Helvetica &ndash; a little too perfect to have much character.)</p>
<p>But I never felt like that. I just loved the music, loved the lyrics, and as uncool as it is now to like a prog rock back, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->still <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really love listening to them. (Other bands of the era like Yes haven&rsquo;t held up nearly as well for me.)</p>
<p>Watching the recent documentary on them (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; highly recommended) was a bit of a revelation for me &ndash; it tells the story of these 3 guys from Toronto (Alex &amp; Geddy &amp; John Rutsey, with Neil coming along after the first album) who were nerds themselves growing up, who never really fit in either. [Yes, I know this fact is/was obvious to even the most casual of outside observers. It took me a little while to deconstruct my own feelings, I guess.] And the doc was great in that it had other rockers &ndash; from Pantera, the Smashing Pumpkins, others &ndash; who were clearly also outsiders and nerds, and admired what the trio from Toronto had done.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s way past being cool to like Rush, if it ever really was, but they and their music still means a lot to me. Really glad to get to see them in concert again, after a few years, and hope to get another chance. (For the record, they sounded really terrific Monday. I think that if Geddy&rsquo;s voice can hold up, they should be around for a few more tours, and I like their new material as much as anything they&rsquo;ve done in probably 20 years.)</p>

			 <p>This week I&rsquo;m moderating an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->online conversation at the Glasshouse Conversations site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; an electronic outgrowth of a series of in-person conversations a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my trip there<!-- raw HTML omitted --> before on this blog; they&rsquo;ve also put up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->page with a video about our conversation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> there on Transparency. It was a unique and amazing experience &ndash; and an interesting conversation and day took place. As the video makes pretty clear, a lot of people came in with the expectation of talking primarily about physical and architectural transparency, but I&rsquo;ve been more interested in transparency as a metaphor &ndash; as a way to live your life, as a way to manage organizations. A lot of interesting ideas came out of the blending of physical and metaphorical ideas of what transparency is.</p>
<p>Of course, in my time at Mozilla this has been a theme we&rsquo;ve come back go again and again, as we try to learn and discover how to lead effectively in an organization built on ideals of transparency. (That isn&rsquo;t the only ideal, and there are many others that it interacts with regularly, but it is an important one for us.)</p>
<p>Leading transparently is often hard - it&rsquo;s tough to know how to be most effective, how to get things done - and often, being transparent seems to be counterproductive. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Maeda<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, after spending his first year as President of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RISD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trying to be as transparent as possible, wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this piece on transparency versus clarity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and a lot of things clicked for me as I read it - I&rsquo;ve come back to it often over the past year or so.</p>
<p>And then the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikileaks/Afghanistan papers situation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> occurred &ndash; and while leaking confidential information is nothing new, I think that the scope of the information leaked, and the way that it was leaked, is something that is quite modern. It raises a serious question: is it even possible to keep secrets in organizations and governments now? Should it be? Is this new transparency good, destructive, a little bit of both, or is it just too early to tell?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeff Jarvis posted a nice piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for thinking about this a couple of weeks back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got lots of thoughts here, as you might imagine &ndash; living and breathing Mozilla over the past 5 years has made some things very clear and others not so much but not that many answers myself, so I&rsquo;d love to hear (and engage with) a broad range of thoughts on this during the week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy to be moderating this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Glass House Conversation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> online. Please contribute.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the past few days I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the various roles I play in life &ndash; father, husband, son, grandson, CEO, friend, advisor, et cetera. There are a lot. And clearly they&rsquo;re getting all mixed up as we live more of our lives online, as we live, work, and play on Facebook or Twiter or e-mail (I&rsquo;m old!) or elsewhere. We&rsquo;re all finding our way there, while we change the world around us.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been struggling with moving between roles the past few days &ndash; and it&rsquo;s got nothing to do with online life &ndash; but I would wager is a decidedly non-modern one.</p>
<p>Kathy &amp; I took SPL to Disneyland for his first trip there. We&rsquo;d been on some smaller outings, like to Legoland, but I&rsquo;ve really wanted to take him to Anaheim for quite a while. There are lots of reasons to be cynical about Disney and Disneyland/Disney World, but I&rsquo;m not &ndash; I really love it there. I love how it feels, even with crowds. I love all the colliding mythologies. Most of all, I love how it makes kids feel when they ride Space Mountain or interact with characters during the parades or watch the fireworks over Sleeping Beauty Castle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to the parks in Anaheim and Orlando both many times, but obviously it was our first trip as the parents of a 5 year old &ndash; so lots of new things to consider in that role.</p>
<p>But we knew earlier in the week that Gigi was in the hospital and might not make it out &ndash; and Friday morning before we left the hotel I got a call from Mom about Gi&rsquo;s prognosis; a few hours later Mom called again to let me know that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gigi had passed away<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We were in line for a ride at the California Adventure side of the park (bumper cars for the Bug&rsquo;s Life section), but the specifics aren&rsquo;t that important, really.</p>
<p>What is important was that at that moment, a bunch of roles I have all crashed into each other at once. I was trying to be a good son for my mother, who had just said good-bye to her own mother. And I was trying to communicate at least a little bit with Kathy, my partner in all things, so she would know what was happening. The line was moving, though, and SPL was anxious to get into the seat of the bumper car so we could crash into his mother&rsquo;s car &ndash; and so I wanted to be a good attentive dad for him. Over the top of all that, though, and of course, I was mostly Gigi&rsquo;s grandson, and mostly Gigi&rsquo;s grandson just felt sad.</p>
<p>I felt those roles all collide with each other a lot over the next couple of days &ndash; sort of like waves crashing at the beach one would come in, and then later be overwhelmed by a different one. It was a hard set of feelings to really understand and process and deal with appropriately &ndash; I don&rsquo;t honestly know whether I&rsquo;ve processed this much yet at all. (Which is one of the reasons that I&rsquo;m  blogging it &ndash; to be able to understand it a little bit better.)</p>
<p>I do know that I was much more aware of the roles that I play in life this week &ndash; and in particular, the roles that really, really matter a lot to me. I think it helped me clarify some of the things I love about being a father, a husband, a son &ndash; but I know this is all a bit of a moving target. Things change, relationships change.</p>
<p>Mostly, I was very happy to be able to spend so much time with Kathy &amp; SPL at a difficult juncture for me. That, I know for sure.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My grandmother, May Pearce Korb, died Friday, August 6, 2010 at the age of 87. She died in a hospital near where she lived on St. Simon&rsquo;s Island in Georgia, following an accident she had last weekend.</p>
<p>She was my mother&rsquo;s mother, and I never knew her as May, really, but rather &ldquo;Gigi,&rdquo; a name she gave herself when I was born. It came from the old Pogo comic - there&rsquo;s a character called Grundoon in it - a wrinkly baby woodchuck that always spoke in gibberish - and she thought I looked a little like that. Thus G.G. for &ldquo;Grundoon&rsquo;s Grandmother.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve never really known what to make of that story (although, in retrospect, not really all that flattering) but she&rsquo;s always just been Gigi to me.</p>
<p>A couple of little glimpses into my memories of her:</p>
<p>When I was growing up, she always used to send cards for about every holiday &ndash; birthday, Christmas, Easter, Halloween, whatever - and they always had a dollar bill in them. She moved to two dollars in the eighties, when I was in my teens and able to spend with more velocity. Those cards continued into college for me, and even after. In 1997, after I&rsquo;d been working at Trilogy and then Apple, we saw each other at my Mom&rsquo;s graduation ceremony (for her Masters in Library Science) and I remember proudly giving Gigi one of my Apple business cards. Without missing a beat, she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sending $2 to a Senior Scientist at Apple??&rdquo; Pretty funny. She was always super quick and super sharp with her humor &ndash; so that, at least, I come by honestly. She&rsquo;s been sending SPL cards with a couple of dollars in them since he was born. A nice tradition and connection to her that always made me smile.</p>
<p>But the thing that I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> remember about her is all the books. She owned a bookstore on St. Simons called The Shorebird, and one of my favorite things to do was to go to work with her. I would sit in the back and read everything back there, for what seemed like hours (but probably wasn&rsquo;t) and remember feeling like I was a very lucky kid - and, of course, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about her a bunch the last few days, naturally, but especially because we&rsquo;ve been at Disneyland, for SPL&rsquo;s first visit there. One of my earliest memories is going to Walt Disney World with Gigi and the rest of the family (since they lived pretty close to Orlando), and it brings a lot of things full circle for me to be here now. More on that in a bit.</p>
<p>She leaves behind such a good family &ndash; my mom and her two brothers, who have been wonderful uncles (and now great uncles), and the seven grandkids (my cousins, my brother, and me), who are such a smart, funny, diverse, and talented group. No small feat.</p>
<p>Anyway, Gigi lived a good life, and I&rsquo;ll miss her a lot.</p>
<p>R.I.P., May Pearce Korb, 1923 - 2010</p>

			 <p>I always used to view parents who dressed their kids like them at places like Disneyland with amusement and/or derision.</p>
<p>Well, after 3 days of SPL waiting for me to get dressed, I now realize that maybe it&rsquo;s the kids, not the parents, setting the fashion agenda.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little mortifying to my finely honed sense of style :-), but is more than made up for by how endearing it is to have a hopper want to be like you. And knowing that it&rsquo;s a phase that won&rsquo;t last forever makes it more precious.</p>
<p>SPL really wanted us to match on the way home today. How can you say no to a five year old on his vacation?? Irresistible.</p>
<p>And voilà: the matching family.</p>
<p>I will happily ignore a little fashion ignominy for SPL to enjoy things even a little bit more.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few days ago, I tweeted an article from TechCrunch about how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon reports that last month, they sold 180 Kindle books for every 100 hardcover books<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a little hard to do a complete analysis from the few numbers that they reported, especially because it&rsquo;s not apples-to-apples on price, titles, etc &ndash; but even directionally, this is an amazing milestone. It&rsquo;s incredible to me how quickly eBooks have emerged, after languishing for so long.</p>
<p>For me personally, it&rsquo;s acute: I don&rsquo;t really even like buying books that I can&rsquo;t get electronically anymore. It shows in my library &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been giving away about 100-200 books a year to our public library, but still have well over 1,000 in the house. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I have more than 150 on my Kindle, after 2 1/2 years.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> My physical library is shrinking, my electronic one growing.</p>
<p>I have zero sentimentality - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->none <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- about the form of the book. I&rsquo;ve noted elsewhere that what I discovered on getting my Kindle is that it isn&rsquo;t particularly books that I love so much, it&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that I love. Novels, non-fiction works, short stories, whatever. It&rsquo;s the words that I&rsquo;ve always cared about, the ideas, the narratives, the characters. Not the wood pulp, the binding glue, the flashy book jackets (that often don&rsquo;t have anything at all to do with the author&rsquo;s intent).</p>
<p>But lately I&rsquo;m worried that as we rush headlong into the electronic future that we&rsquo;re losing something.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear that we&rsquo;re not reading as well &ndash; every reader I talk with reports that they&rsquo;re not comprehending the books quite as deeply as they used to. I believe we&rsquo;ll get better at reading electronically, and the format will allow better paging through and spatial memory eventually, but that&rsquo;s far from obvious to me. (Most avid readers I talk with say that they can usually remember where on the page they read something &ndash; top left, lower right, in the middle, whatever &ndash; and that&rsquo;s always been true for me. The reflowable digital form obviously breaks that spatial memory, and is a bit of a problem.)</p>
<p>But the thing I&rsquo;m worried about more lately is the disappearance of books in our physical spaces. I&rsquo;ve always found that when I go visit peoples' houses that what&rsquo;s on their bookshelves is a bit of a lens into their lives and their values. Almost invariably when people come over to our house for dinner, I&rsquo;ll hand them a book from my shelves that they&rsquo;re interested in with no expectation (or desire, actually) to get the book back.</p>
<p>I find it even in my own home &ndash; when I&rsquo;m in the office, I&rsquo;ll often notice a cluster of books about something that reminds me of a time in my life, or stokes an old curiosity, or that just makes me happy.</p>
<p>But now the books we have in our house don&rsquo;t really represent the current me. We tend to have 3 categories: (1) kids books, (2) coffee table books, and (3) books from our past that we haven&rsquo;t given away yet. I believe that will happen in most homes &ndash; and maybe it already has been, since the introduction of the television &ndash; and it makes our personal spaces much more anonymous &ndash; more screens, less deep content.</p>
<p>I feel the same thing as I travel around &ndash; in the airport or on airplanes, nobody can see what I&rsquo;m reading. Mostly, that&rsquo;s okay with me &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t really want to talk to my seat neighbor about Stieg Larsson that much anyway. But it bugs me more that my wife can&rsquo;t see what I&rsquo;m reading &ndash; the books used to serve as an instant conversation-starter. Now the reading experience is faceless, not conversation-inviting at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll replace books as a lens into our brains and lives with something else &ndash; digital picture frames? Facebook pages glowing from our walls at home?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think we&rsquo;re losing something in the process. That always happens as we move from one technology to the next, but we&rsquo;ve overturned a 500 year old technology in less than a decade, and it&rsquo;s going to be very disorienting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never missed reading physical books nearly as much as I miss having the physical artifacts in our world, and how so many clues to who we are are disappearing along with them.</p>

			 <p>This the third in my series of posts about my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent left shoulder injury<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->subsequent surgery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to repair/reconstruct my labrum and reattach/tighten the capsule. It&rsquo;s a little rambly.</p>
<p>I know that I&rsquo;m writing and tweeting a lot about all of this lately &ndash; to be honest, it occupies a huge part of my brain &ndash; it&rsquo;s a big deal for me this year. I was talking with someone over the weekend who said he&rsquo;d had a similar surgery last year, and that it completely changed the complexion of his year. I&rsquo;m finding the same thing &ndash; it dominates my mood and thinking &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s how the shoulder hurts, the psychology of maneuvering with the sling, whatever.</p>
<p>Other than just being on my mind a lot, I&rsquo;m writing so much for a couple of other reasons. First, as a reminder to myself over the years of the specifics of the injury and recovery. Second, because as I progress through this, I&rsquo;m finding relevant information about what everything feels like to be tough to find on the web, and I hope that it can help others who are going through it.</p>
<p>My last post was a couple of weeks after the surgery, and we&rsquo;re now a couple of weeks past that &ndash; I saw the surgeon Tuesday and things looked good enough to stop wearing the sling and start physical therapy. I&rsquo;m <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->happy not to wear the sling anymore. The physical aspects were annoying, but it was really the psychological aspects that I was getting tired of &ndash; being in a sling for weeks, I found that I started to think of myself as less vital, more gimpy. I knew it wasn&rsquo;t really true, and it was just temporary, but it wore on me a lot in any case.</p>
<p>Overall, things are going well &ndash; it&rsquo;s been pretty painful overall &ndash; and lately my shoulder hurts most of the time (although it goes up and down). Sleeping has consistently been the biggest problem. Was hard to sleep with the sling, is hard to sleep with the soreness and sharp pains when I move in the wrong way. But making it through.</p>
<p>Wednesday I started physical therapy &ndash; I&rsquo;ve got 2 weeks of passive stretching &amp; range of motion exercises (I move the arm with my other arm, or the physical therapist moves it) and then another couple of weeks of active range of motion (where I use the arm itself). After that, 4 weeks of resistance training rehab, and who knows after that. So now I&rsquo;m about 5 days into it. The exercises aren&rsquo;t complicated &ndash; it&rsquo;s about 30 minutes of laying with my arms wide, stretching them on an exercise ball, doing pendulums, etc. They&rsquo;re designed to stretch out the capsule that holds the shoulder. The point of the surgery is to tighten up the capsule &ndash; and they overtighten it in surgery and use PT to loosen it to a manageable level.</p>
<p>The most interesting/freaky aspect of this phase is psychological, too &ndash; the therapist on Wednesday moved my shoulder into positions that my brain <!-- raw HTML omitted -->knows <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will dislocate &ndash; or rather would have dislocated before the repair. So when I start to approach those positions, I&rsquo;m finding myself tense up and fight against the motion, which makes everything hurt more. I find it&rsquo;s also triggering a strong fear response &ndash; just a very strong aversion to letting my arm get moved around, some feeling of nausea, etc. The next day, the first one where I was doing the exercises by myself with nobody to ask questions of, was actually a little scarier to me, just because it was a completely unknown feeling.</p>
<p>The good news is that, as of today, Day 5, things are going really well. The difference between today and last week is astonishing, and I&rsquo;m finding that every day my range of motion is a little bit bigger, and the fear &amp; nausea responses are becoming less severe and happening less often. It hurts most of the time &ndash; there&rsquo;s not really any time that goes by that I&rsquo;m not aware of it and devoting some attention to it. But it feels pretty good in the mornings now, and hurts more through the day as it gets more tired.</p>
<p>I find, too, that I&rsquo;m trying to be as aggressive as I can about it &ndash; doing the exercises a couple of times a day instead of just once (I asked whether that would be okay) &ndash; so hopefully that&rsquo;s helping. I know I can&rsquo;t accelerate it that much &ndash; I think a lot of it is just diligence and time to heal.</p>
<p>The most amazing thing so far is that I can&rsquo;t remember, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at all, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what the surgery and rehab was like when I first repaired the shoulder, in a much more invasive open procedure, in 1990. I literally can&rsquo;t remember going to a physical therapist, can&rsquo;t figure out when I got better, since I didn&rsquo;t take any time off from school, and can only vaguely remember being in the hospital (it was a 3 day thing instead of just the morning like this year). I can remember a lot about both years at Stanford before and after it, but really nothing about getting my shoulder better. Weird.</p>
<p>Anyway, this note is a little all over the place, which is a little how I feel, too. :-) But I&rsquo;m happy to be more active now, and optimistic that the rehab is going well and starting to convince myself that my shoulder really is repaired.</p>

<p>My shoulder repair surgery was 11 days ago now, and things seem to be going pretty well. 17 more days with my sling, not that I&rsquo;m counting, really. Pretty minimal pain at this point, except at night, when it&rsquo;s pretty brutal &ndash; I think laying down on my back or side puts the shoulder into a position that puts pressure on the repair. So I&rsquo;m not sleeping very well at all, which is discouraging, but overall I&rsquo;m quite happy with how things are progressing, and am fired up about getting into PT in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I am blown away by the precision of the arthroscopic surgery. When I had my shoulder repaired 20 years ago, they made a 4 inch incision, detached the muscle from the bone, and generally had to open everything up to get in to repair things &ndash; that meant a 3 day stay in the hospital, and a long &amp; painful rehab, although I don&rsquo;t really remember much about it, honestly.</p>
<p>This time the experience is much different. I&rsquo;ve got 3 band aids on my shoulder covering up 4mm incisions where the camera, vacuum and tools went in. My stay in the surgery center was 3 hours instead of 3 days. And as I&rsquo;m recovering, it&rsquo;s clear that only a few of the surrounding muscles and tendons and ligaments were really very disrupted. (Wearing my arm in the sling, by contrast, is creating more complaints &ndash; sort of a contact rash, a very sore elbow, and my wrist is pretty tweaked.)</p>
<p>On the whole, though, so far so good. 2 weeks left in the sling, then 4 weeks of PT (1st week is passive, where they will move my arm around; next 3 are active), then 4 weeks of strengthening. Feeling pretty doable at this point. Lots to see as I start to use the joint again, but optimistic so far.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve included the pictures from the surgery above (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->click through to see the full size<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), although I don&rsquo;t really understand too much about how to read them. If you number the pictures 1-9, going from left to right, top to bottom, here are a few choice shots:</p>

			 <p>[This is mostly for my own future-self edification than for general interest, but might be useful to others with shoulder issues.]</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I dislocated my left shoulder, and am planning to have it surgically repaired a couple of weeks from now. I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything unusual at the time &ndash; was only putting my iPad on my bedside table &ndash; but put my arm in a bad position and the shoulder came out. (As a side note, for those of you keeping score at home: Kindle: 0 shoulder injuries. iPad: 1 shoulder injury.) Anyway, it came out, and Kathy was good enough to hold my forearm for me so that I could get my shoulder back in the socket.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a longstanding problem for me. I first dislocated my shoulder when I was 14 years old (give or take) &ndash; our soccer team had practice one evening, but another team was using the field, so we were warming up on the asphalt basketball court. I was dribbling around a guy but tripped over his foot, and caught my fall with my left arm, and my shoulder popped out. It took about 90 minutes to get me to the hospital and see a doctor &ndash; when I saw one, he lifted my arm above my head, and the shoulder got reseated, much to my relief. In retrospect, I don&rsquo;t really know how much it hurt, but I know that I was pretty scared because I had never been through anything like that before.</p>
<p>I went through the normal rehab and physical therapy, but had continued problems &ndash; my shoulder dislocated maybe a dozen more times up until my freshman year at Stanford. It got to be so that the slightest thing could cause it &ndash; even turning over in my sleep did it a couple of times. So I decided to see a surgeon about doing something more to repair it.</p>
<p>In either 1990 or 1991, I had surgery near Dallas &ndash; something called a Bankart procedure to repair the tear in my labrum and to retension the capsule. It was an open procedure &ndash; not like the arthroscopic procedures that are most common today &ndash; and I remember it being tough to recover from, even as a 19 year old. Was in the hospital for 3 or 4 days, then a ton of rehab after that.</p>
<p>But the really, really great news was that my arm didn&rsquo;t dislocate anymore. I lost some range of motion in the shoulder, basically because they tightened the capsule more than &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; But it was definitely worth it to have a more stable shoulder. In 1997 or 1998, though, it happened again during a softball game at Stanford, as I was in the batter&rsquo;s circle. Surprised me, and hurt a lot.</p>
<p>And then, life was better for a while. I started lifting weights around that time, and generally getting into better shape, and my shoulder got stronger than it had ever been.</p>
<p>Until a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in to see Dr. Eakin at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation a couple of times now, and I like him &ndash; he was pretty clear from the outset that I would very likely need surgery, and after looking at the x-rays and MRI images, it&rsquo;s confirmed.</p>
<p>He actually drew me the set of pictures above &ndash; the top left shows a top view of the shoulder &ndash; you can see the ball connected to the very shallow socket, with the pointy bits of cartilage called the labrum keeping it in, along with the capsule that&rsquo;s surrounding the ball. When the dislocation happened, as shown in the upper right diagram, it broke part of my labrum and detached the  capsule (or stretched it really thin). The procedure he&rsquo;s suggesting is called a Bankhart procedure (I think) to repair the labrum and retension the capsule, resulting in the happy picture in the middle of the image. Unlike the procedure I had 20 years ago, this will be an arthroscopic one.</p>
<p>One side note is that part of the ball chipped during some earlier dislocations &ndash; resulting in the notch he&rsquo;s drawn. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be causing me any particular issues at the moment.</p>
<p>As a rule, I&rsquo;m very hesitant to choose surgery &ndash; it&rsquo;s just very difficult to undo if something goes wrong. But since I&rsquo;ve had such trouble over the years with this shoulder, and since it&rsquo;s been surgically repaired before, I&rsquo;m pretty clear that it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. I think that if I don&rsquo;t do it, my shoulder will always feel very unstable, and will have a pretty high likelihood of coming out again. I figure I can heal better now than I&rsquo;ll be able to in the future.</p>
<p>Rehab is longer than I was hoping for &ndash; 1 week out of work, then 4-6 weeks in a sling, then 4-6 weeks in physical therapy, then another 4 weeks of strengthening work. So it eats up a lot of the summer, and is a little hard to swallow because I&rsquo;m feeling pretty good right now, am able to go to the gym, etc. But I should come out of the summer with a more stable shoulder for the long term, so I think it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, I&rsquo;ll note that my right shoulder has dislocated a couple of times, too, but is decidedly more stable, and doesn&rsquo;t really give me any problems at this point. My brother has dislocated one of his, too.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I&rsquo;ve said other places, it&rsquo;s a bummer, but I&rsquo;m not really too unhappy about this development. I&rsquo;ve got time to take care of it without hugely disrupting life, and it&rsquo;s basically a fixable problem, with a minimum of drama. I&rsquo;ll be able to do some working out while I rehab (like the exercise bike), so that will help, too. And I&rsquo;d always take shoulder problems over knee issues &ndash; don&rsquo;t have to walk on my shoulders.</p>
<p>Surgery in a couple of weeks &ndash; hopefully I&rsquo;ll be in the 80% happy category on Dr. Eakin&rsquo;s drawing. :-)</p>

			 <p>I just announced internally that after 5 years at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and a couple as the CEO, I&rsquo;ve decided to leave later this year to join <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Greylock Partners<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a venture partner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be in my role here at Mozilla until we conclude a successful search for a new CEO, and intend to stay involved and on the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have more to say about Mozilla over the next few months as we go through transition &ndash; I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of the work we&rsquo;ve done over the last several years, and very optimistic about what the future holds.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll have  more to say about Greylock as I move into my new role there. Venture investing is what I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for quite a long time &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been involved in many startups, even building an incubator a decade ago, and have interests that span enterprise, open source, and the broader web, among others. I&rsquo;m incredibly excited to join an amazing team there &ndash; it&rsquo;s a firm that I&rsquo;ve noted to be incredibly strongly oriented towards entrepreneurs &ndash; it really matches my sensibilities as an operator extremely well.</p>
<p>Will be blogging and tweeting (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@johnolilly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) as per normal &ndash; more soon. Below is the letter I sent to everyone here at Mozilla, who I am deeply indebted to and proud of.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As my five year anniversary at Mozilla approaches, I&rsquo;ve decided that it&rsquo;s time for me to move on to my next role sometime later this year. This won&rsquo;t happen today or tomorrow &ndash; I expect to be here and working for several months yet, and I&rsquo;m planning to stay on the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>This is a tough note for me to write &ndash; I feel so incredibly lucky and humbled to have worked on such an amazing project, with such spectacular people, for the last few years.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve always been a startup guy at heart &ndash; Mozilla was originally going to be a quick volunteer effort for me, but quickly turned into a full time job, and at the beginning of 2008 turned into the CEO job that I have now. I&rsquo;ve really been missing working with startups, and want to learn how to invest in and build great new startups, so am planning to join Greylock Partners as a Venture Partner once we transition here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in no rush, and the most important thing to me is to build the strongest Mozilla we can, with the best leadership possible. So my plan is to stay through that transition &ndash; we&rsquo;re starting a CEO search now, and plan to do it in as transparent a way as possible &ndash; which means I&rsquo;ll continue in my CEO role as normal for several more months, at least.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have more to say on the transition as we figure things out more clearly, but for now, business as usual. We&rsquo;ve got Firefox 4 to ship, and Firefox on multiple mobile platforms. We&rsquo;ve got our web services like Weave to stand up and make available to millions of users.</p>
<p>For now, though, I really want to communicate a deep gratitude to each of you &ndash; over the past few years we&rsquo;ve done an amazing amount together, and changed the world in so many meaningful ways. 400 million users are directly touched every day by the work we&rsquo;ve done so far, and many, many more are using better browsers because of our work. There are many more contributions and victories to come.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://johnolilly.com/2010/05/10/reading-books-on-ipad-and.html">Reading Books on iPad and Kindle: A Comparison</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://johnolilly.com/2010/05/10/reading-books-on-ipad-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2010-05-11 10:22:06 &#43;0700">May 11, 2010</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve now had my iPad long enough to read a couple of books all the way through and compare to the experience of reading books on my Kindle. I&rsquo;ve come to the opinion that I think for many (most?) people, the iPad will be the more compelling choice. That includes people who read just a few books each year, as well as students, as texts for school become more interactive and engaging. But for lifelong readers like myself, who read long books frequently, the Kindle is a superior reading experience for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>In other words, they&rsquo;re different devices, and one is not the superset of the other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through a few stages in coming to this conclusion &ndash; pre-iPad I was convinced the iPad wouldn&rsquo;t be any good for reading at all. I was wrong. The first few weeks I had my iPad, I didn&rsquo;t turn on my Kindle a single time. But the last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been balancing out usage, and finding that I&rsquo;m much happier.</p>
<p>The iPad is, for sure, a better experience for magazines, newspapers, and (obviously) web content. (Not to mention video and interactive stuff, which the current Kindle can&rsquo;t even attempt.) It&rsquo;s quite an acceptable reading experience for books, too, especially if you&rsquo;re reading just a few pages at a time.</p>
<p>But whenever I tried to read for a longer time, I found a few problems. It&rsquo;s pretty heavy to hold in one hand. The touch UI means the screen is always smudgy and needs attention (that same attention I&rsquo;m trying to pay to the actual content). It&rsquo;s not very comfortable to hold laying down in bed. And I found that the backlit screen tended to get me worked up as I was trying to drift off to sleep &ndash; sort of defeating the whole purpose.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an unusual psychological effect that happens. My brain tends to think of my iPad first in terms of communication &ndash; checking mail, following Twitter, whatever. And so even when I&rsquo;m trying to focus on a book, I find myself hopping out of the book for just a few seconds to check up on things. With Kindle, my brain seems to understand that I&rsquo;m in long-form-reading mode, and stays more still.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve read full books on both devices over the past few weeks, what I&rsquo;ve found empirically is that I can read faster, and for longer, and with better understanding and recall when I&rsquo;m using my Kindle than when I&rsquo;m reading on my iPad. I can&rsquo;t prove that to you for a certainty, but it&rsquo;s very obvious in my recent reading &ndash; there&rsquo;s just no comparison. So for me, the iPad can&rsquo;t supersede the Kindle. They&rsquo;re different devices for different purposes.</p>
<p>When I use the iPad, in a lot of ways, I feel like I&rsquo;m living in the future. It&rsquo;s an amazing device &ndash; beautiful, fun to throw data around, etc. And ultimately is an incredibly interesting split between form and function. (The form has essentially nothing that indicates what the function is &ndash; it&rsquo;s perfectly plastic.)</p>
<p>And looking at the Kindle, it feels a lot like I&rsquo;m looking at the past. It&rsquo;s kind of a homely looking device. Has too many buttons in weird shapes. It&rsquo;s black and white. Strange to say that about an invention that didn&rsquo;t even really exist 3 years ago.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s that in-the-past-ness of the Kindle that&rsquo;s also its great strength. I find my mind more still, more focused. I find myself able to pay utmost attention to the content, and to really live in the words and ideas. In an age where I&rsquo;m super-twitchy to read my tweets and mails all the time, the focusing effects of Kindle vs iPad feels like a real throwback win.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear to me at this point that we&rsquo;ve moving into a world where we&rsquo;ll all have multiple screens around us &ndash; things we used to call &ldquo;televisions,&rdquo; or &ldquo;phones,&rdquo; or &ldquo;eBooks,&rdquo; or &ldquo;computers.&rdquo; And some of those screens will be have their own light and computing power like iPad; others will have reflective displays and mostly show content that comes from the cloud, like Kindle. I think as consumers, we&rsquo;ll increasingly want all our content on whatever screen happens to fit our current circumstance. What&rsquo;s around, what&rsquo;s easy to hold, maybe what&rsquo;s easy to share with others. It&rsquo;s very clear that we&rsquo;ll have screens everywhere, and content connected to all of them.</p>
<p>Anyway, like I said at the top: I think that for most folks who only read a little bit, the value proposition of the iPad and everything it can do will be superior.</p>
<p>But for a guy who for his whole life has never gone anywhere without a book in his hand, the iPad just doesn&rsquo;t serve me as well as the Kindle for reading books right now. That might change; I might adjust. We&rsquo;ll see. But for now, for me, my Kindle is the place for books.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the story of a small international paper that&rsquo;s based in Rome. Each chapter follows a different person who&rsquo;s involved in the paper somehow, and there are interstitials that tell the story of the paper through the decades.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, does it?</p>
<p>And yet it was a very enjoyable read to me &ndash; the characters were all interesting and varied; the paper was weird and undistinguished enough to make you wonder at motivations of everyone; and the prose and dialog was really tight and thoughtful.</p>
<p>Definitely recommended, even if it&rsquo;s a bit outside of your normal read.</p>

			 <p>Today FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski <!-- raw HTML omitted -->issued a statement<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that articulated a new jurisdictional approach, based on Title II of the Communications Act, to realize the open Internet principles commonly known as net neutrality.  By addressing the common carrier aspect of broadband services, the proposal seeks to limit regulatory reach by focusing on the transmission component.  The essence of a common carrier is that they provide data transport, unaltered, and without discrimination, irrespective of its type or origin. The narrowly tailored approach is intended to address the fears and concerns held by many, ourselves included, that the FCC would acquire authority to regulate the Internet – which few think is good idea.</p>
<p>While fights over jurisdictional basis will provide ample material for debate and discussion, what’s most important is that the open Internet principles are adopted.  An open Internet is essential to the continued innovation, growth, and entrepreneurship that has changed our lives and created a host of new opportunities.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget, the Internet is young. For example, it’s been roughly 7,000 days since the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->announcement of the world wide web<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Who would have predicted its impact on our lives in this short period?  Companies like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook didn’t even exist 2,200 days ago.  There is no dispute that the web has facilitated profound <!-- raw HTML omitted -->social, economic, and even political change<!-- raw HTML omitted --> all around the world. Even notions that were once new like “ecommerce” have faded away, as now, nearly all forms of commerce touch upon or utilize the Internet.  Remember when we even wondered whether people would shop online? A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2009 study by Professor John Quelch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> published in the Harvard Business Review estimated that the web accounted for $85 billion in annual retail transactions.</p>
<p>Openness is the quintessential quality of the Internet upon which all of these developments are founded. Given our experience in this short time, what the next 7,000 days will look like is no doubt uncertain.  What is certain, however, is that if we fail to preserve and protect the open Internet, we risk losing the full promise of the web.  That’s a risk not worth taking, especially in light of what we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>We commend the Commission for its efforts to strike the proper balance of preservation without over-reaching. What Chairman Genachowski has proposed demonstrates exceptional awareness of the importance of preserving key principles of Internet openness without wholesale over-regulation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll explain the significance of the picture later, but for now, here&rsquo;s the background: it&rsquo;s me, on a Christmas morning a long time ago, in the basement of the Rome, NY house where we lived. Obviously, I&rsquo;m adorable, but that&rsquo;s not my point right now. The more important feature of the picture is the television at the right &ndash; it&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heathkit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I&rsquo;ll talk about it more below.</p>
<p>Ever since the iPad was announced &amp; described, I&rsquo;ve had the elements of a post swirling around in my head. My friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ben last week wrote his<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it says a lot of the things that I was planning to say &ndash; you should go read it. I don&rsquo;t necessarily think all of the same things are important, although I agree with him on most of it. For me, the essential point is that we &ndash; Americans, netizens, techies, almost any grouping that I can think of that&rsquo;s meaningful &ndash; are at our best when we are makers, when we tinker, when we invent. We&rsquo;re at our best when we&rsquo;re taking things apart &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s technology, laws, organizations &ndash; twisting them around to see how they work, tweaking them this way and that, and eventually creating something new.</p>
<p>Invention and entrepreneurship is at the heart of change and progress; hacking and tinkering is the thing that leads to that invention.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, what worries me about the trajectory of computing is not so much the emergence of tightly-controlled, non-tinkerable boxes, but the presumption that &ldquo;normal people&rdquo; don&rsquo;t ever want to tinker, don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with understanding how things work. I think it&rsquo;s not true, really &ndash; certainly not for everyone &ndash; but I even think that this distinction between &ldquo;normal people&rdquo; and &ldquo;tinkerers&rdquo; or &ldquo;techies&rdquo; or &ldquo;makers&rdquo; is bogus at best, and really dangerously corrosive at worst.</p>
<p>So like Ben, I&rsquo;ll get an iPad and am really excited about it from an interaction point of view (so please be clear, this is not an anti-iPad rant or an anti-Apple rant), and because it makes computing more human scale than ever &ndash; just like my Kindle has done. But I have real misgivings about it because of the controlled, closed stance that it&rsquo;s starting from, and that other technology companies and technologists are adopting.</p>
<p>But first, a little bit of a story about my own background and evolution as an engineer, and how that happened at all.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, I remember my dad futzing around with everything. I remember him having a workshop in each of the houses we lived in (we moved around every few years as the Air Force stationed him in different places). I remember him working on our cars, our plumbing, and on our electrical systems in every house, on appliances, everything. I remember we seem to have built a deck for every house we ever lived in.</p>
<p>But I have this especially strong memory that until I was probably 10 or 11, every television we bought would come in a kit, as a box full of parts, that Dad would put together &ndash; it was always a project for him. Now, as a kid, having a Heathkit television was basically mortifying. I mean, I just wanted us to go buy a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; television at Sears like everyone else did. Our TV didn&rsquo;t look like other folks, and being different as a kid is always a tough feeling.</p>
<p>And, in fact, our first computer was a Sinclair Z-80 that, you guessed it, came in a kit. Then, since there was no prepackaged software to run on it, I typed in a bunch of BASIC programs from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BYTE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> magazine. Good times.</p>
<p>The upside of that awkward feeling as a kid, though, has been significant and long lasting. The upside is that I&rsquo;ve never really viewed technology as something that was magic. It always had components that added up to the whole, that you could replace, that you could mix in different ways. I&rsquo;ve always felt like technology (and organizations, and laws, and most everything else) comes to us in a way that we should be poking at it, thinking about how things work, wondering how to make things better, wondering what would happen if you removed certain things.</p>
<p>I think people will say to me: &ldquo;Well, of course. You&rsquo;re an engineer; you&rsquo;re a tinkerer. That&rsquo;s what engineers do &ndash; normal people don&rsquo;t assume they can rewire their house, or swap out a power supply on their TV or change the way an operating system works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s bogus. It&rsquo;s not like I was born an engineer &ndash; the instinct to fiddle with things isn&rsquo;t something we&rsquo;re born with. I became a tinkerer because I was exposed to surfaces that allowed &ndash; that invited &ndash; it. I figured out that I liked tweaking and building and creating because I got a bunch of chances to do that stuff, from hardware to software and everything in between. I knew I could do it because Dad modeled that behavior, but also because the stuff we had around the house was inspectable and malleable.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t misunderstand: I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a real problem that I can&rsquo;t change the capacitors in my television today &ndash; I think that the most interesting surfaces for tinkering tend to evolve over time &ndash; and today the primary tinkering substrate appears to me to be the open web.</p>
<p>What I do think is a problem is that today, unless you buy the Apple SDK you can&rsquo;t modify the software on the device that you already purchased &ndash; that jailbreaking is criminalized and actively fought against. That&rsquo;s a problem not because $99 is so exorbitant, but because people who don&rsquo;t know they could be tinkerers &ndash; who haven&rsquo;t gotten the chances that they need &ndash; won&rsquo;t ever get them in that situation. That&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s tremendous creativity being unleashed by the rise of the iPhone and next the iPad &ndash; that&rsquo;s a great thing. And I don&rsquo;t really have any problem with Apple building systems the way they want to &ndash; they create excellent products and experiences.</p>
<p>The thing that I&rsquo;m worried about is this feeling that seems to be growing in technology communities that &ldquo;normal people&rdquo; &ndash; these non-tinkerers &ndash; don&rsquo;t want to tweak things, shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to tweak things, can&rsquo;t be trusted with technical matters. Many will choose not to, I completely agree. But we shouldn&rsquo;t presume such.</p>
<p>We all have the potential inside us to make things. But we&rsquo;re not born into the world as makers &ndash; the world around us &ndash; the people in it and the artifacts in it &ndash; help us to discover what we can be.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On the occasion of Microsoft starting to roll out tests of the Browser Choice Screen in parts of Europe this week, Mitchell and I, along with others, have written a short letter about why choices that we make matter greatly, and why browser choice matters now more than ever.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things to say here, and I&rsquo;ll repost the content of our letter below (you can find it as well at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->opentochoice.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a mini-site we&rsquo;ve set up to celebrate and explore the choices that we have and need).</p>
<p>But the argument we&rsquo;re making boils down to this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I hope that you&rsquo;ll write &amp; blog &amp; tweet about the important aspects of choice and user control as well, to add your voice to the conversation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our lives are full of choices. Where to eat? What to read? Who to  spend time with?</p>
<p>The choices we make determine the quality of our life, and how we see  the world. So many of these choices we take quite seriously, weighing  the consequences, thinking about the implications, and choosing  carefully and thoughtfully.</p>
<p>So it’s strange, then, that the majority of people in the world  haven’t ever considered the Web browser on their computer or mobile  phone — that so many people every day use the browser that comes by  default.</p>
<p>It’s an important choice because the Web browser has become one of  the most critical and trusted relationships of our modern lives – with  nearly perfect knowledge of everything we do. It is the lens through  which we look at the virtual world, and the medium by which we connect,  learn, share, and collaborate. The browser you choose is responsible for  providing you with the necessary tools to manage your online life, and  to protect your privacy and security.</p>
<p>And so we’re pleased to support the European Commission and Microsoft  in also recognizing how important choice is. In accordance with a  landmark settlement, if you’re using a Windows PC in Europe and you’re  still using the default Web browser, in the coming weeks and months  you’ll see a Browser Choice screen appear. That screen will provide you  the opportunity to make an active choice in the source of the software  that acts on your behalf to broker your online experiences, and meet  your own unique needs and interests.</p>
<p>As an international non-profit organization, Mozilla has always  believed that the freedom to make smart choices should be central to  making the Web, and the world, a better place. This shows through with  Mozilla Firefox, a free, open-source Web browser that more than 350  million people around the world have chosen to use every day. Values of  choice and self-determination are built into everything that we do,  including Firefox.</p>
<p>We believe that the Browser Choice screen is an important milestone  towards helping more people take control of their online lives — and we  hope for the conversation to become broader and deeper. We’ve set up  opentochoice.org as one place for you to discuss what this choice means  to you — and we hope that you’ll add your own voice to this conversation  and those to come.</p>
<p>Whether or not you decide to keep your current Web browser, we  encourage you to learn more about your browser and the impacts it has on  the way you see the world, and to make your own choice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about books lately &ndash; obviously because of the developments of eBooks, but also because I&rsquo;ve been home sick the past few days, reading as I get better, and just generally around all my books more of the time.</p>
<p>I happened to walk by a shelf in our living room filled with books from our family &ndash; mostly older books, and mostly from my dad&rsquo;s mother (she was always &ldquo;Grandmother&rdquo; to me). When she died, I inherited a number of her Latin books, since I really loved learning Latin, and it was something that was important to her, too. For whatever reason, I picked one up off the shelf today &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cooper&rsquo;s Virgil &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an annotated collection of the writing of Virgil (who wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Aeneid, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->among other things).</p>
<p>Just picking it up, a million different things came up in my mind. Some reverence for how old it is. Fondness for the Latin work and friends I had in high school. Memories of Grandmother, always teaching, and pretty often whipping me in double solitaire, which I&rsquo;m starting to teach SPL now.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the back cover page (you can click through to see it bigger):</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now the first thing you&rsquo;ll notice is that the book is old. It looks like Gussie Raysor acquired it (or just signed it) on May 26, 1895, just about 115 years ago now.</p>
<p>Think of that. 1895 was when the first movie projector was patented. Queen Victoria was still alive, and Teddy Roosevelt wasn&rsquo;t yet President of the United States. The Ford Motor Company wouldn&rsquo;t be founded for another 8 years.</p>
<p>The next thing that I noticed was the name at the top &ndash; Laura Lilly &ndash; who is definitely not my grandmother, but instead was her sister-in-law &ndash; my grandfather&rsquo;s sister. So that&rsquo;s a little bit of humor there. I guess my grandfather stole the book from his sister (although I have to say that I can&rsquo;t really imagine him giving much of a damn about Latin &ndash; unless it was some sort of prank, which I can imagine him caring about), and then the book got absorbed into Grandmother&rsquo;s collection (given her love of language and learning and books, not too surprising). Gussie Raysor was my grandfather&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>And so through this artifact that I&rsquo;ve moved around several times over the past couple of decades, and that surely frustrated any number of Lillys as they tried to learn their declensions and conjugations and gerunds &ndash; through this simple artifact, a connection across the years was made. And with real impact and emotion in the present day.</p>
<p>That is a hell of a thing. It&rsquo;s just really astonishing in simplicity and power.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not very nostalgic about books, I have to say. I thought I would be &ndash; I thought I&rsquo;d miss their paper &amp; binding shape with the advent of eBooks. But I really don&rsquo;t &ndash; not at all, honestly. I prefer, in most cases, to read books on my Kindle now &ndash; which tells me, as I&rsquo;ve written elsewhere, that what I really love is reading, not the physical forms themselves.</p>
<p>Still:</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about physical artifacts that reaches across the ages. As I look around my own house and think about what objects with meaning will persist and SPL&rsquo;s grandchildren will look at a hundred years from now, I&rsquo;m not sure there are very many at all. There are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lots <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of electronic artifacts, like this blog, even, if we can manage to keep them alive and safe from inevitable(?) bit-rot. But precious few things that will make it through the childhoods and moves and marriages and storms and whatever else that the next 100 years will bring.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad to have these books of my grandmother&rsquo;s with me. They mean something and they change who I am and how I experience the world because they&rsquo;re here with me. And it&rsquo;s probably time to think a little bit not in the backwards direction, but in the forwards direction, about what we want people to reflect over a hundred years hence.</p>

			 <p>In the main, this isn&rsquo;t a post about the iPad, although there&rsquo;s a bunch of relevance there, and the conclusion mostly is about the iPad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with different reading form factors for digital books over the last few weeks &ndash; I&rsquo;ve of course had my various Kindles (Kindlii?) for a couple of years now, and have basically come to love them. I&rsquo;ve read maybe a hundred books, at least a couple of over a thousand pages, and would not trade it. It is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->decidedly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not a perfect device, and is&hellip;what&rsquo;s the word?&hellip;oh, right: ugly. But it gets a lot right for the way that I use it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also been experimenting with reading on my iPhone (via the Kindle app) and on my laptop (again, via the Kindle app) &ndash; and I&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->written about some of my early experience in that mode<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And when I say &ldquo;experimenting,&rdquo; what I mean is that I&rsquo;ve been reading whole, long form books on it. When I went to Austin a couple of weeks ago, I intentionally didn&rsquo;t bring my Kindle, preferring to try traveling without it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been trying to read longer chapters and parts of books on my laptop, through the Kindle application for Windows.</p>
<p>So the first conclusion is one that I&rsquo;ve made before: it&rsquo;s having your book content in the cloud that really makes the big difference. Being able to read your books on any screen that you happen to have with you is the thing that matters.</p>
<p>But beyond that, I&rsquo;m finding that I&rsquo;m a more capable and thoughtful reader when I use the Kindle, as opposed to the other devices. It&rsquo;s a little hard to explain, but I can maintain a certain stillness and focus when I&rsquo;m using the Kindle that I haven&rsquo;t been able to achieve when reading on the iPhone or laptop &ndash; I find that on those 2 devices, I&rsquo;m a little fidgety, and my mind tends to wander towards all the other things I can do on them. My retention isn&rsquo;t as good as it is when I&rsquo;m reading on the Kindle itself, and my attention span isn&rsquo;t as long.</p>
<p>I think there are a few factors here:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But for me, the Kindle is the must-have device for reading, with the iPhone app a very nice-to-have that I use sometimes, and the laptop really as an only occasional use device &ndash; it&rsquo;ll get better when they introduce searching and cataloging, but won&rsquo;t ever be primary.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know how that will change, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for me, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with the advent of the iPad. First off, I&rsquo;ll very likely get one &ndash; this isn&rsquo;t about that, it&rsquo;s about whether I&rsquo;ll read most books on it. I think they&rsquo;ve done a number of very nice things in the user experience on it, and it looks like a more intimate media device than I&rsquo;ve ever seen, really.</p>
<p>[As an aside, I noticed a ton of UI elements that seemed bizarre. A wood grain bookshelf actually in the graphics? Showing the pages and the bindings of the books? The spiral tab in the date book? Weird throwbacks to already out-of-date physical forms &ndash; I guess intended to be for the metaphor bridge for the mass market, but still weird.]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little hard to tell until I get to read longer books on an iPad, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be the book-reading device for me.</p>
<p>I think it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->be exceptional for many other things, and for people who don&rsquo;t read as many books, or mostly read shorter form material, it&rsquo;s going to be very worth paying the additional money to get the functionality over the Kindle. In other words, for people for whom reading is an occasional activity, or for just a few minutes a day, I think the iPad and devices like it will be fine.</p>
<p>I have a nagging suspicion that it will continue the erosion of our ability to read long form books, and actually to make long form arguments &ndash; with our politics and our marketing and everything else turning into snippets, I think that&rsquo;s not such a great thing. But I recognize that&rsquo;s a curmudgeony attitude.</p>
<p>I just get the feeling that the ability to watch movies and listen to music and swipe pictures around, etc etc, on a device that is people&rsquo;s primary way to also consume books, will mean that the relative time spent reading will go down.</p>
<p>Some other random thoughts:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For now, for me, I&rsquo;ll keep reading on my Kindle for the foreseeable future, even while swiping around on the iPad for more dynamic content.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had a Nexus One for a couple of weeks now, and think that with Android 2.1, it&rsquo;s a good advance. Right at the moment, I&rsquo;m having issues with the battery &ndash; can&rsquo;t hold a charge for more than about 5 minutes, even after multiple varieties of soft &amp; hard resets. But setting that aside, I think it&rsquo;s a good device with a good operating system.</p>
<p>A few thoughts on the comparisons &ndash; I think I&rsquo;m not adding much here that hasn&rsquo;t already been written:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I&rsquo;m encouraged by the advances of Android &amp; the Nexus One &ndash; and fully expect that the huge array of players in the ecosystem will push things forward more quickly now &ndash; ultimately, we as consumers really need a platform for our mobile lives that&rsquo;s an alternative to Cupertino &ndash; not because of what Apple is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per se, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but because multiple choices means that everyone has to get better.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, I blogged about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why I returned my Zeo sleep tracker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; I liked it, but didn&rsquo;t trust the data as much as I wanted to. A few days after I posted, I was contacted by Derek Haswell, who manages a bunch of their social media efforts &ndash; he had noticed my tweets and blog, and sent me a note to see if I&rsquo;d be willing to chat with him and their VP of Scientific Affairs, John Shambroom. My initial experience with the Zeo notwithstanding, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the company, and am up for helping anyone who&rsquo;s trying to help us all understand sleep a little bit better. So I spent a half hour or so on the phone with them chatting about my experience and some of the science in the Zeo.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll recall that the last straw for me was that the Zeo wasn&rsquo;t registering periods of wakefulness that I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->knew <!-- raw HTML omitted -->were happening &ndash; 5 or 10 minutes at a time &ndash; so that undermined my faith it it. Shambroom said that, counter-intuitively, determining wake state is actually harder than telling the difference between light sleep, deep sleep, and REM &ndash; the brain waves (or whatever) just aren&rsquo;t really differentiated enough from light sleep. So periods of wakefulness are a weak point in the system.</p>
<p>We talked for a while about the implications of that &ndash; and ultimately I came to this understanding: my relationship with sleep is a pretty emotional one, and often intensely frustrating. What I mean when I say that is that because I&rsquo;ve had trouble sleeping my whole life &ndash; with both apnea and insomnia issues &ndash; and it&rsquo;s such a hard problem to debug properly, combined with the fact that when I can&rsquo;t sleep I&rsquo;m always tired &amp; cranky &ndash; that all adds up to a lot of emotional context when trying to figure out my sleep. And in particular, the parts when I&rsquo;m awake and can&rsquo;t get back to sleep are the most obviously frustrating, since I&rsquo;m asleep during the other times.</p>
<p>And so when you take the fact that the Zeo fell down on tracking a scientifically not-that-interesting issue (short periods of wakefulness), but highly emotionally charged one (can&rsquo;t sleep!), that adds up to a perception problem (at least) for Zeo. They&rsquo;re working on it, though, and I&rsquo;m encouraged that they&rsquo;re really trying to get this better as they go.</p>
<p>I was really happy for them to reach out to me to understand my own situation, and was really happy with their followups after the call (they sent me some research that may help me understand some things better).</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next improvement from them, and my overall experience so far has been pretty good.</p>

			 <p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m about 5 days into my experiment with Android on the Nexus One. Mostly I agree with what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MG writes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; I&rsquo;ll put some other thoughts down later.</p>
<p>But the thing that I&rsquo;m struggling with the most is calendar. The built-in calendar is really mostly built for Google Calendar, although I think it can subscribe (but not edit or publish) to .ics files. So that&rsquo;s great if you&rsquo;re using Google Calendar, not so much if you&rsquo;re using anything else.</p>
<p>Here at Mozilla, we run Zimbra for mail, calendar, messaging, etc. With my iPhone, I just set up the CalDAV account, and it works <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>With my Android phone, so far best solution is to use the 3rd party app TouchDown, but I don&rsquo;t love it &ndash; for all the reasons you&rsquo;d imagine not loving a 3rd party Exchange client. :-)</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m willing to jump through a couple of hoops here &ndash; syncing Zimbra with GCal maybe? &ndash; but am a little stumped on what the best thing to do is. My calendar essentially runs my life &ndash; without it, it&rsquo;s going to be hard to live with the Android.</p>

			 <p>Deb sent me a note a few days ago wanting to know how I deal with all my mail each day &ndash; one of the things I&rsquo;ve always been really good about is e-mail responsiveness. When I sent her something back, she noted it would be a good blog post, so here you go. :-)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s that combo of stuff that I do. I now pretty much don&rsquo;t file things away, either &ndash; I put them either into &ldquo;FileToKeep&rdquo; (which I keep for a long time) or (mostly) into &ldquo;FileToTrash&rdquo; (which I clean out so that I only have 3 months of past mail in it).</p>
<p>I think the critical things are: (1) treating it purely as a work queue (and getting off every other mailing, or separating to another account, like bugmail), (2) having a discipline about quickly giving <em>some</em> response, (3) moving long running tasks to a task list and (4) getting it very close to zero when you start, as I think it&rsquo;s difficult to whittle down over time (I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of inboxes with thousands of messages in them &ndash; don&rsquo;t know how you can do anything with those.)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do. You?</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to visit Rome for a long time &ndash; since high school when I learned about it in Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s Latin class, really. But I&rsquo;d never been &ndash; there aren&rsquo;t a ton of reasons to get there for work, and I&rsquo;d never been on holiday either.</p>
<p>But a couple of weeks ago, I got a chance to go for a few days of vacation there, prior to a visit to our Paris office and attending the Monaco Media Forum. Thanks to my mom being kind enough to visit, Kathy was able to go as well, so we got to spend a fantastic 4 days together exploring Rome.</p>
<p>I have a lot of different reactions to Rome &ndash; but the main one is that it feels like 4 or 5 different, distinct cities that all happen to be located in the same place. There&rsquo;s Ancient Rome, of course, and Catholic Rome (and the Vatican) &ndash; and Renaissance Rome (including the home of the Medicis) and modern, International Rome. These are all related to each other, naturally (for example, the Popes underwrote much of the Renaissance work) &ndash; but just felt really distinct to me &ndash; a little more than I expected. (There are also some interesting monuments to Italian nationalism built earlier in the 20th century, celebrating people like Vittorio Emmanuel II, first king of a united Italy.)</p>
<p>In some parts of Rome, the various periods collide in interesting ways &ndash; the Pantheon, for example, has functioned more or less continuously since being built by Agrippa in the first century BC (and then rebuilt in the 2nd century AD) &ndash; it&rsquo;s now a Catholic church, but also is where Vittorio Emmanuel is buried, not to mention Raphael &ndash; and is of course, despite being nearly 2,000 years old, the largest concrete dome in the world.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I found the Pantheon to be incredible &ndash; there&rsquo;s something about the proportions of the building that make it feel incredibly stable &ndash; there&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rightness <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to it that&rsquo;s incredibly compelling. (I think the iconic status of the place plays into that, but it&rsquo;s not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that.)</p>
<p>And the Roman Forum and the structures of the emperors on the Palatine hill were amazing, of course. There&rsquo;s something about being able to walk through the forum, to walk through Domus Augustana (the villa that the Flavians built), and just try to imagine what it looked like, what it felt like, how life must have been. I&rsquo;d always heard the aphorism: &ldquo;Augustus found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble,&rdquo; but not really internalized what that meant &ndash; as you walk around the Palatine &amp; the Forum, you get a sense &ndash; many of the buildings have small holes in them &ndash; where the metal hooks had been that had previously held the marble facing for buildings (and that metal was eventually melted down to make ammunition, centuries later, naturally).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The permanence of the ancient buildings is astounding, and &ndash; especially taken with the incredible Colosseum, and the remnants of the aqueducts nearby &ndash; really hammers home the point that this civilization, for all its obvious faults, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really knew what it was doing. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Their level of building, planning, administration, and just general control of civic life was unprecedented, and incredible.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Of course, the next question you&rsquo;re faced with is this: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what the hell happened? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We know, of course, with hindsight that what happened was invaders from the North, and the middle/dark ages, and the plague, and a shift of power to Constantinople in the East. But, really, it took a thousand years after the fall of Rome to start to approach the level of competence of the Romans again.</p>
<p>What a remarkable thing. I think most of us think of history as a more or less one direction proposition: progress. (We can debate for a while whether, you know, tending to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->virtual fish &amp; farms<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is, strictly speaking, but you know what I mean.) And maybe the progress is of a technological sort, or maybe it&rsquo;s geographic, moving from civilization to civilization.</p>
<p>But you never think the whole world (give or take) will take a gigantic, centuries-long, step <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backwards. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We all read about it in school, of course, and understand it intellectually, but being there, seeing it and thinking about it just left me breathless.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Anyway. Fantastic trip; hope to get back to see more than just Rome, and spend more time in the city itself, too. Will hold onto my camera better next time, too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->set of pictures of Rome, plus out the window from my hotel room in Monte Carlo, up on Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. (Taken with our smaller Lumix LX-3 camera, which is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fantastic.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I blogged a bit ago<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I recently picked up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zeo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; it&rsquo;s a sleep monitor for tracking states of sleep each night. Ive always had trouble sleeping and so have a bit of a fascination with understanding sleep and how it affects me personally.</p>
<p>After about 30 days, I&rsquo;ve decided to return it, because I have suspicions that the data collection isn&rsquo;t very accurate. I woke up several times each night &ndash; times that I was alert enough to get out of bed, walk to the bathroom and back, and then eventually go back to sleep &ndash; but the Zeo didn&rsquo;t seem to register those periods of wakefulness. There are some disclaimers that it doesn&rsquo;t trigger for periods of less than 2 minutes, which I understand, but these were more than that. The waking periods aren&rsquo;t such a big deal &ndash; obviously I don&rsquo;t really need to track them since I&rsquo;m awake &amp; alert enough to manually note them. But the fact that the unit wasn&rsquo;t tracking them correctly made me feel like the rest of the data was suspect as well.</p>
<p>So I sent it back today &ndash; I&rsquo;m really disappointed. I&rsquo;m optimistic, though, about both the Zeo company and the future of sleep sensors (and really a huge variety of biometric sensors). The product design and execution of the unit were both outstanding, and the way it integrates with an online coaching system is excellent. (The chart above is actually a chart I generated myself in Numbers with the CSV export of my sleep data.)</p>
<p>I loved the product, loved the way it made me mindful of sleep patterns &amp; factors that affect it &ndash; just didn&rsquo;t trust the data, ultimately, so felt sort of silly to keep it.</p>

			 <p>This morning, I&rsquo;m a signatory on behalf of Mozilla on an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->open letter to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski<!-- raw HTML omitted --> regarding his proposed principles for Net Neutrality. There&rsquo;s quite a lot of support for this letter &ndash; you can see a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bit of a writeup here at the WSJ<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think we&rsquo;ll have a bit more to say on this in the coming days, but for now, I just wanted to highlight a few points.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In general, the Net <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has been neutral <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for the really explosive innovation phase over the last 15 years or so. Much of what&rsquo;s being proposed is about protecting that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s good experience &amp; real data from around the world that supports neutrality as we move from the first phase of broadband rollout to the next. If you have the time, I highly encourage you to read the FCC-commissioned Broadband Study from the Berkman Center (with Yochai Benkler as Primary Investigator) [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->PDF link<!-- raw HTML omitted -->]. There&rsquo;s actual data in it (a lot of it) and worldwide experience that we can use to develop our own policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making sure that the mobile Internet is as open as the wired Internet has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is crucial. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We need 1 global Internet, not a collection of non-open ones.</p>

<p>I just got my new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zeo sleep monitor system<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I was excited to order it for a couple of reasons &ndash; the main one is that I sleep horribly &ndash; have my whole life. I tend to wake up several times a night and then I toss &amp; turn a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s some mix of mild apnea and some insomnia &ndash; it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve always lived with, but am feeling stressed enough about that I&rsquo;m more actively working to make it better now.</p>
<p>The second reason I&rsquo;m excited about it is because I&rsquo;m really interested in the rise of personal sensors. I think we&rsquo;re at the very beginning of a long boom of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people using sensors they buy retail to track a whole variety of characteristics about themselves. I&rsquo;ve been using Nike+ with my Nano to run for several years, and it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->absolutely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->changes my behavior because I&rsquo;m measuring it. Devices like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zeo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FitBit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are early in the wave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post more about the system when I have some time &ndash; it&rsquo;s a full system at this point &ndash; sensor, info collector (the alarm clock), cloud storage (where you upload your data), and web interface to information, coaching, etc. (plus daily coaching e-mails based on a few factors).</p>
<p>[As an aside, I think all these things are fully integrated systems now mostly because it&rsquo;s early days &ndash; over time, I think you&rsquo;ll see platforms that let, say, your Nike+ and your Zeo show you consolidated &amp; correlated information &amp; coaching.]</p>
<p>For now, though, just wanted to share a graph of last night&rsquo;s sleep (above). Turns out I got a good amount of deep sleep &amp; REM sleep, which are both important &ndash; but it wasn&rsquo;t very efficient sleep, as I spent much of the night in light sleep (and wake, which I think is underrepresented on the graph).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more&hellip;</p>

<p>This is my 2nd post about the Aspen Institute event on the future of journalism &ndash; more on what went on &amp; some thoughts I have. It&rsquo;s long overdue, and is a follow-on post to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this earlier post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my punchline: I leave Aspen with no doubt that there is a crisis for traditional metro newspapers, and many will not survive. But I have to say that beyond some nostalgia, that doesn&rsquo;t make me feel very bad, because I also leave with the sense that while there&rsquo;s much change ahead for journalism as a profession and an industry, there&rsquo;s no crisis. There&rsquo;s significant innovation happening and new opportunities opening up for talented &amp; dedicated people to find.</p>
<p>So I guess I leave Aspen optimistic, and much more optimistic than I expected to be.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Format<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There were about 50 people, give or take, which I understand is relatively large for an Aspen Institute event. The morning sessions were about 3 hours or so, with all of us around a (very large) table (picture above), moderated by Charlie Firestone &ndash; he&rsquo;s an exceptional moderator, great at figuring out when to let everyone go into depth and when to move on. After lunch each day we had smaller breakout sessions, facilitated by various leaders (my 2 were led by Jeff Jarvis of CUNY and Sue Gardner of Wikimedia) &ndash; those went a couple of hours and then the leaderes worked on a synthesis and summary to present to the whole group the next day.</p>
<p>I talked with a few people who had been to events like this before, and I guess this felt a little bit on the large side, but with pretty great engagement and participation by some really outstanding people.</p>
<p>I will note that it was not a particularly diverse group &ndash; white men over 40 dominated &ndash; but there were a number of women that participated, and a few other non-white-men. But with a subject like this &ndash; and in particular with it&rsquo;s relevance to how democracy works (or doesn&rsquo;t work) &ndash; I think we&rsquo;d all be best served with more diversity of thought &amp; background.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some Things That We&rsquo;ve Talked About<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We started the sessions Monday by talking about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Knight Commission on the Needs of Communities in a Democracy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; Marissa, who&rsquo;s co-chair, gave an update on their progress and some thoughts about what may be in the report when they issue it later this year. It&rsquo;s going to be a report worth reading, and highlights both concerns about where journalism may be failing us as a democracy and some potential solutions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s framed a lot of our discussions this week &ndash; the idea that democracies need certain services, some provided by journalists, to succeed and thrive. And John Carroll, the former editor of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Los Angeles Times, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->started with a definition: that journalism provides the information needed [for people] to be free and self-governing. (from <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Elements of Journalism<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by Kovach and Rosenstiel)</p>
<p>I struggle with the focus on American journalism, for what it&rsquo;s worth. I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s the right way to think about the characteristics that are important for an engaged citizenry &ndash; because, clearly, there are other places in the world today where certain aspects of informing citizens are being much better served than here in the US. Still, I think that Scott Lewis (CEO of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->voiceofsandiego.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) said it best (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing): &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not really here to talk about saving newspapers or journalists' jobs &ndash; but there are some beautiful parts of the history of journalism in America, and we&rsquo;re here to talk about which those are and how to preserve the most beautiful and necessary in a time of change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s got it right, I think. It&rsquo;s not really about &ldquo;saving&rdquo; or &ldquo;preserving&rdquo; institutions &ndash; it should be about figuring out what we need in a modern world, what&rsquo;s possible with technology, and what characteristics and skills and ethics should be non-negotiable.</p>
<p>One thing that I found particularly interesting is that there&rsquo;s not much concern at all about national &amp; international publications &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Financial Times<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, to name a few. The consensus is that those institutions, while under pressure and experimenting, will figure out how to survive. The most concern was about local papers, really, and about the loss of investigative journalism. And I think the basic assumption that most people here are making is that most metro newspapers will not be able to survive, at least not without change that will make them unrecognizable.</p>
<p>That, too, seems right to me, and I have to say that I&rsquo;m not too sorry about this development. Local papers were always geographically-based monopolies &ndash; vertical integrations of information that had high barriers to entry due to the cost of printing &amp; distribution &amp; ad sales. It seems okay to me that they&rsquo;ll go away, by and large (because I think you&rsquo;ll get what you most need in different ways &ndash; classifieds by things like CraigsList, sports news from any number of places, local event information from hyper-local blogs, and investigative reporting from a couple of new classes of org that I&rsquo;ll talk about below). It&rsquo;s sad when newspapers disappear, for sure &ndash; many of these are 50 or 100 year institutions that have served their public well &ndash; but I think that in the overall scheme of things, this is not such a terrible problem.</p>
<p>The breakup of these vertically integrated companies will mean that there&rsquo;s a much more complicated creation chain that will happen, and that we&rsquo;ll get our news and information in increasingly unique (to each of us) ways. I&rsquo;m most hopeful that this will allow smaller, more focused organizations to contribute however they&rsquo;re best able to contribute. I think that will mean a mix of non-profit and for-profit, a mix of big &amp; small, a mix of points-of-view, purposes, and ways of working. I think there is no doubt that this will be a hugely chaotic time as we evolve into what&rsquo;s next, and I think it will be some time while we all learn how to read again (understanding point-of-view, and the way that stories are constructed), but eventually we&rsquo;ll be in a better place than ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m encouraged by the work of many of the attendees, but in particular these: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Voice of San Diego<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Center for Investigative Research<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pro Publica<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m in Princeton, NJ, at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Institute of Advanced Studies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (home to many amazing people &amp; events, like Einstein, Oppenheimer, von Neuman, and more) for an event called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adventures of the Mind<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; 150 high potential high school students from across the US gathered together. They&rsquo;ve also invited ~40 mentors to give talks about how we got from there (high school) to here &ndash; flash talks of 10 minutes or so. So far last night &amp; this morning, we&rsquo;ve heard from 2 Nobel Laureates in Physics (of the 9 who are here!), 2 poet laureates of the US (including Billy Collins, who is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hilarious <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and read some amazing poetry), we&rsquo;ve heard from John Maeda and Annie Duke and Senator Patrick Leahy just got on stage to talk. So an intimidating lineup, for sure.</p>
<p>For the record, when they announced that I work for Mozilla on Firefox, everyone burst into applause, so that helped a lot. :-)</p>
<p>The emerging theme is that everyone who&rsquo;s had any type of success has had more than their fair share of mistakes, of periods of muddling through.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this is what I said during my 10 minutes&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>I started preparing for this talk like I always do: by blogging &amp; tweeting. I asked people what sorts of advice they&rsquo;d give to their high school selves that wouldn&rsquo;t sound like safely ignorable advice from an old guy. I didn&rsquo;t get back a ton that met that test, honestly, except the sentiment that no matter what I said, it&rsquo;ll probably sound like advice from an old guy (I&rsquo;m a little sensitive about getting older now because I just got back from my 20th high school reunion!).</p>
<p>Vicky asked me to talk today about how we got where we are, and what we did to get here, and where we&rsquo;re heading.</p>
<p>So as I started thinking about what to talk with all of you about, I found that I kept thinking about the turning points in my life &ndash; the inflection points where something I did or decided had a really profound impact on what my life would become. And it&rsquo;s not that hard &ndash; I can look back at the 20 years or so since I was sitting where you were (more or less), and pinpoint a bunch of them &ndash; maybe 5 or 10 that really made a difference.
And here&rsquo;s the thing: thinking back on all of them, when I was making those decisions, I never really had much idea that they were very important decisions. Let me say that again: for most of the important turning points in my life, I treated them with a little less seriousness than, you know, buying my next iPod. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that I didn&rsquo;t recognize that sometimes decisions would have effects, or that I didn&rsquo;t take them seriously. What I&rsquo;m saying is that a bunch of decisions that I thought were really important turned out to be not important at all, and some things I decided to do just for fun changed everything (like when I went to visit an old high school friend in Jamaica who would eventually become my wife.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick story to illustrate a turning point that I didn&rsquo;t realize until much later. When I was a junior in college, I had decided to major in computer science, and was starting to get interested in something called Human Computer Interaction &ndash; designing systems for people to be able to use them effectively. I went to a lunchtime seminar by a guy named Robert Cailliau &ndash; a physicist from Switzerland of all places &ndash; and he brought with him a giant black computer called a NeXT &ndash; Steve Jobs' creation that would eventually turn into the Macintosh that we know today. He started giving a demo of a program where you could bring up a page full of text and pictures, and click on blue underlined text to get to other pages full of text and pictures. And I remember saying to myself, &ldquo;Huh, I guess that&rsquo;s sort of neat &ndash; text &amp; pictures, click click click.&rdquo; And the next thing I remember was waking up when everyone was gathering up all their stuff to leave &ndash; I had fallen asleep &ndash; and missed, of course, the first demonstration I&rsquo;d ever seen (or most people had ever seen) of the World Wide Web. So there you go &ndash; one of those powerful inflection points in my life &ndash; and I slept through it.</p>
<p>My theme throughout my few minutes here is going to be this: you never know when a decision you make is going to have a profound effect in your life. At least, I&rsquo;ve never been able to tell. So my coping strategy &ndash; what I do to make everything work for me &ndash; is try to put myself into situations where there are tons of great choices, tons of great people, tons of great outcomes possible &ndash; so that it makes the odds that I make some really important &amp; good choices that much better.</p>
<p>In high school, I felt like had everything pretty together &ndash; I loved math &amp; physics in particular, and did pretty well &ndash; figured that I&rsquo;d major in physics and if I didn&rsquo;t get straight A pluses, I&rsquo;d mostly get them. So of course I got to Stanford my freshman year, took my first physics class and proceeded to get my ass kicked. It was pretty horrifying, actually. Have you ever seen those bar charts with the numbers of people who got each grade? A histogram distribution of how everyone did? Yeah, so I had my own solitary bar, way over to the left hand side of the chart &ndash; and that&rsquo;s not the good side. I quickly decided maybe physics wouldn&rsquo;t be for me, but I did really start to enjoy computer science, and that&rsquo;s where I focused.</p>
<p>Anyway, from Stanford I went to a startup in Austin where I realized I&rsquo;d never be world class at programming or designing, but I could be world class at some other stuff &ndash; things like finding great people and hiring them and building awesome groups.</p>
<p>After a couple of years I went back to Apple, where I had been an intern during college &ndash; put yourself into situations where there are mostly great choices, remember? 1997 was an odd time at Apple &ndash; it&rsquo;s when Steve came back and changed the place immediately &ndash; he&rsquo;d always been a bit of an idol of mine. But as he started making decisions to change Apple, I saw them hurt a lot of the people there who I really cared about and respected &ndash; so then, at age 26, I decided it was time to start creating my own thing, and I set off with my mentor from Apple, my 2 best friends, and we started our own company, Reactivity. And through Reactivity, I got to meet and work with many of the people I&rsquo;m closest to now &amp; who are my mentors and peers and co-conspirators.</p>
<p>We did that for 7 years before I decided it was time for me to do something else. (and a little while after I left, Reactivity was bought by Cisco, a happy event for everyone.)</p>
<p>And then, as I say, another accident. I was looking around for what to do next &ndash; I thought I might start a new company or become a venture capitalist &ndash; but during that time I got to know this little team of people at Mozilla &ndash; there were probably 15 employees at the time (but a much larger community) &ndash; they had just released Firefox about 6 months earlier, and they were changing the world. So I joined. My basic line of reasoning went like this: how often do you get a chance to really change the world?</p>
<p>I think not all that much, to be honest. Since then, I&rsquo;ve moved through a few jobs at Mozilla, becoming the CEO about 18 months ago. Now we&rsquo;re up to about 250 employees around the world &ndash; places like California and Toronto and Paris and Tokyo and Beijing and Auckland &ndash; and about 300 million people (nearly 25% of the web) use our software each month to interact with the web.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re spending our time on a few things: working on making Firefox on Windows &amp; Mac &amp; Linux better than ever &ndash; we just released version 3.5 last month, and are already working on the next few. We&rsquo;ve got a mobile version coming out &ndash; not for iPhone yet, but for some other handhelds &ndash; because it&rsquo;s pretty clear that everyone is going to be using the web in their pocket from here on out. We&rsquo;re a 250 person company that&rsquo;s competing with Microsoft &amp; Apple &amp; Google &ndash; all of whom are relentlessly working on and improving their own browsers. So it&rsquo;s never dull. Competing with these guys &ndash; playing on this level &ndash; is brutal &ndash; there&rsquo;s always more to do just to stay in place, there are always challenges to react to. But now that I&rsquo;ve done it, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine not being in this environment.</p>
<p>Craig Newmark, founder of Craigslist, a couple of days ago in Aspen said as a joke that he was like the Forrest Gump of the Internet &ndash; and you&rsquo;re all too young to even know what that reference is, but it comes from a movie where the title character, Forrest Gump, was accidentally around some of the most interesting events in the world over the period of his life. For Craig to say that is ridiculous, of course. The real thing is that Craig is a very smart dude, and he&rsquo;s been in situations where being smart and making choices can really matter. And so he&rsquo;s been able to change the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with a couple of other thoughts, both given to me by one of my mentors, a professor at Stanford named Tom Kosnik.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read several books about how we get our food and how we eat &ndash; books like Pollan&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Omnivore&rsquo;s Dilemma<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for example &ndash; both because I&rsquo;m interested at a personal level about how to live my life differently, but also because I&rsquo;m interested in the public health &amp; sustainability implications.</p>
<p>Kessler spends a fair bit of time going over pretty well-trod ground about how manipulative the US food industry is &ndash; how they layer fat, salt and sugar relentlessly in order to get us to chronically overeat &ndash; what he calls conditioned hypereating. That all seems right to me, but has been covered in a lot of other books &amp; films.</p>
<p>The more interesting part of the book deals with how our brain reacts to stimulus and why we do things that we know won&rsquo;t give us what we want or need (like eating that cookie instead of an apple). Here&rsquo;s how to sum it up:</p>

<p>I really liked a lot of Palahniuk&rsquo;s earlier work &ndash; especially books like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fight Club <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; but lately I&rsquo;ve been having a tough time with his writing. It&rsquo;s all very very skilled, just not that much fun or rewarding to read. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pygmy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is in that category. It&rsquo;s got occasionally hilarious parts, but most of it is just a slog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a middle school/high school exchange student from a fictional revolutionary company &ndash; he &amp; his other operatives come over to start Operation Havoc &ndash; a terrorist operation aimed at the US&rsquo;s science fairs.</p>
<p>This must have been a very hard book to write, because it&rsquo;s all in the broken, angry English of the main character &ndash; so props to Palahniuk for that &ndash; and I have to say that it&rsquo;s a better effort than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Snuff, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but I wouldn&rsquo;t really recommend it.</p>
<p>One funny part was the main character&rsquo;s description of playing dodge ball in PE, which I&rsquo;ll put here:</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I mentioned<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I&rsquo;ve been in Aspen this week at The Aspen Institute&rsquo;s Forum on Communications &amp; Society (specifically titled: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of the Press: Models for Preserving American Journalism<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->). It&rsquo;s been a very interesting couple of days, and I&rsquo;ve got a lot of new ideas to make sense of and synthesize. First a bit of background, then a little bit on what&rsquo;s gone on here and what interesting ideas have been put forward, then I&rsquo;ll try to pull it all together with some thoughts. As I&rsquo;m writing this, it&rsquo;s getting a little long, so I think I&rsquo;ll split into 2 posts: this one about why I&rsquo;m attending, and the next one about the meeting &amp; some thoughts.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why I Came<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know very much about journalism &ndash; next to nothing, really. But I do think that some aspects of journalism are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->critical <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if you want to have an engaged citizenry &ndash; a strong &amp; free press is essential for any of us to know and understand enough about the world we live in to participate and engage. I think, too, that there are aspects of our American press that have historically served  us extremely well and are worth preserving. And of course, it&rsquo;s impossible not to see the turmoil and change that the whole sector is going through &ndash; the disappearance of major papers is only the most visible. One thing I think I hadn&rsquo;t really internalized is that the global economic crisis is really changing the situation much more rapidly than usually happens. Because of the financial pressure, old institutions don&rsquo;t have the buffer that they might have had in better times &ndash; leading to much shorter time frames to layoffs and shutdowns. I think much of this was coming anyway &ndash; the crisis just accelerated all of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been struck lately by some of the parallels of  mission of journalists (roughly, to enable engaged &amp; informed participation) and Mozilla  (to insure an open &amp; participatory Internet). So that&rsquo;s one reason I decided to come &ndash; to learn as much as I could.</p>
<p>The third reason I decided to come is that there&rsquo;s something new afoot in the world: lots of organizations are being created to serve a public interest &ndash; on very low cost models (enabled essentially by the Web) &ndash; and competing with traditional profit-oriented ventures. At Mozilla we call that type of organization a &ldquo;hybrid,&rdquo; and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mark Surman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been writing about that idea a lot lately. For that, I came in the spirit of sharing what we&rsquo;ve learned at Mozilla as we&rsquo;ve become a sustainable hybrid company &ndash; maybe some of what we&rsquo;ve learned can be helpful to others.</p>
<p>But I have to say that mostly I came, as with any event, is because of the other people who were planning to attend and participate. I was invited by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alberto Ibargüen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, CEO of the Knight Foundation, and all around awesome person. He&rsquo;s done much since coming to Knight to reform the way they supported and funded new organizations, starting programs like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Knight News Challenge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as a way to create a sort of prize economy around innovations in journalism. (They&rsquo;ve also provided funding for work at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PCF<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where I&rsquo;m on the board of directors.) What they&rsquo;re doing at Knight is a model to be emulated, I think &ndash; lots of experiments, lots of support, lots of provocative questions.</p>
<p>But beyond just Alberto, here&rsquo;s a sampling of some of the 50 or so people who are here: Vivian Shiller (CEO of NPR), Esther Dyson, Jeff Jarvis (CUNY Professor), Marissa Mayer (VP Google), Dean Singleton (Chair of the AP), Marcus Brauchli (Exec Ed of The Washington Post), Walter Isaacson (biographer &amp; CEO of Aspen Institute), Madeline Albright (former US Secretary of State), Reed Hundt (former Chair FCC), Jon Leibowitz (Chair FTC), Michael Kinsley, Sue Gardner (ED of Wikimedia), Craig Newmark (founder of Craigslist), Robert Rosenthal (ED of CIR), Paul Steigler (CEO of Pro Publica).</p>
<p>And those are just a few of the names I picked out looking at the list just now &ndash; it&rsquo;s neat to be a part of such a small &amp; accomplished group &ndash; and is especially great when it&rsquo;s on a topic I&rsquo;m just learning about. :-)</p>
<p>Finally, and beyond all the basic reasons for coming, I&rsquo;ve learned that it&rsquo;s important to try to pop out of operational work from time to time. It&rsquo;s easy in the day-to-day of Mozilla to get obsessed with solving problems, with getting roadblocks moved out, with the details of trying to make things work. But being too much in those details for too long means, for me, that I sometimes lose sight of the bigger picture &ndash; being around others in a new context helps to reframe the things that matter in work and in life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here: to learn and to participate and to help where I can. It&rsquo;s been a successful event from that perspective for me.</p>

			 <p>This is an unusual week for me &ndash; I&rsquo;m at the Aspen Institute sessions on the future of journalism beginning of the week (blogging to come; still synthesizing some), and tomorrow I&rsquo;m heading to Princeton for an even more unusual event called Adventures of the Mind. It&rsquo;s a program that collects ~150 super-high potential high school students and brings in interesting people to talk as mentors &amp; such. There will be about 30-40 mentors, including a number of Nobel prize winners in science, poet laureates, very successful educators, thinkers &amp; business folks &ndash; and me.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the question I have for everyone: if you had 10 minutes to talk to, you know, someone like you 20 years earlier, what would you do with that 10 minutes?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m heading to Aspen Sunday to take part in a Knight Foundation-sponsored gathering on the future of journalism. It&rsquo;ll be 50 or so attendees, all of whom are very accomplished and have an incredible amount to add to the conversation. I don&rsquo;t know a ton about journalism, so am mostly going to try to listen and understand, but also I think that there are some learnings from Mozilla that may be relevant. So it should be fun; I&rsquo;ll try to blog about it mid-week next week.</p>
<p>In the meantime, anyone have thoughts about what&rsquo;s interesting in journalism? What you&rsquo;re worried about? What you&rsquo;re excited about?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not really sure what I expected from my 20th high school reunion last week in San Antonio &ndash; or I guess I should say that I had expectations, just not specific ones. I think I figured I&rsquo;d come away with some sort of understanding or insight &ndash; some &ldquo;a ha&rdquo; about my high school experience and the intervening years and who I am now. I&rsquo;m not sure I got any of that insight, but I had a really wonderful time, and have at least a few thoughts on life 20 years on from the summer of 1989 when we all embarked from high school to build our lives.</p>
<p>But first a couple of bits of background.</p>
<p>The first thing I should say is that I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;my&rdquo; reunion, but it was really &ldquo;our&rdquo; 20th reunion: Kathy &amp; I were both Class of 1989 at MacArthur High School in San Antonio, where we had met 4 years earlier in marching band. That first year we didn&rsquo;t interact too much, but knew each other a little bit &ndash; then a little bit later we started dating. Then for a pretty long time we did whatever you&rsquo;d call the opposite of dating. Then a bit of indeterminate relationship status ensued. We cycled around a bit. I&rsquo;m sure everyone else thought it was sort of funny. (sort of.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, we graduated and went off to opposite coasts; eventually reconnecting when Kathy was teaching in Jamaica and I was working in Austin in 1995. 5 years later, after a move to California, we got married, and then SPL came along a little over 4 years ago now. Your typical story.</p>
<p>So we had a bit of an built-in advantage when it comes to enjoying the weekend &ndash; we had a bunch of shared history. And that part was really great.</p>
<p>The second bit of context I should share is that I really liked high school a lot. Which is not to say that I was always happy &ndash; I remember that as a time of awkwardness and uncertainty &ndash; of trying to figure out what the hell to do and how the hell to act, and getting it wrong (or thinking I was) an awful lot of the time. But despite the awkwardness, Mac was really good for me, and some of the friendships and relationships and learnings from my time there form the foundation for how I operate today.</p>
<p>I grew up an Air Force brat, always moving around every 3 or 4 years as Dad got stationed in all these exotic locations. (e.g. Omaha, Rome NY, San Antonio, Las Vegas, etc&hellip;) We lived in San Antonio from 8th through 12th grades for me, and that was a good solid stretch of time. It was interesting this weekend to see Kathy interact with people she&rsquo;s known since she was in 1st grade &ndash; so I guess more than 30 years now.</p>
<p>Anyway, Mac was good for me partly because it was the first place my family stayed for a while, but also because of two incredibly outstanding experiences I was involved in: marching band and Latin club.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ll pause while you clean up the mess from that spit-take you just did when you realized what a stereotypical nerd I was then &ndash; and still am, really. We are who we are. :-)</p>
<p>Band was singularly amazing. Friday nights in Texas are a bit of a thing &ndash; if you&rsquo;ve ever seen Friday Night Lights, I can attest that it really does feel like that; there&rsquo;s a momentum to high school Fridays in Texas that peaks at the football games and the hanging out that all the different groups did after the games. It&rsquo;s all a lot over the top, and, again, lives up to the stereotype. And band was a big part of those Fridays &ndash; and, like football, in Texas they went a little over the top with band competition. Something like 300 bands compete every year, finishing up with state finals in Longhorn Stadium at UT.</p>
<p>The year before we were freshmen, the MacArthur Band and Flags had won the state championship &ndash; a first for the school &ndash; led by a band director who was a bit of an institution &ndash; everyone loved Bill Brady and wanted to do well for him. Our freshman year we started 3 weeks before school started &ndash; same time as the fall sports teams started &ndash; and the goal was to win the championship a 2nd year. A few months into the season, Mr. Brady had a heart attack and passed away unexpectedly &ndash; it&rsquo;s still a little emotional for me to think about &ndash; and was my first real experience with death.</p>
<p>We all grieved for a while, and then picked ourselves up to try to do our best for him. And in a bit of a storybook turn, a couple of months later, on a rainy night at Longhorn Stadium, we won the state championship again. That&rsquo;s the first experience I can remember of bigness &ndash; a situation that felt larger than life, that&rsquo;s etched in my memory &ndash; and the first experience I can remember of a group of people being so focused, so locked in on what they were doing and where they were and who they could be &ndash; and everything just going right.</p>
<p>The next year we were lucky to get another outstanding director and teacher, Linda McDavitt, We never quite won state again, but we did well in the following years, and in the band hall &amp; on the  marching field, we all learned together how to work hard, how to become really outstanding at something, how to try to catch a glimpse of transcendence. How to lead, and follow, and work together, really. It seems like a small thing, so many years ago, but I don&rsquo;t really know who I would have become without that experience.</p>
<p>Latin contest was the same way for me, but even nerdier and probably less interesting to write about here &ndash; but it was just as important in helping me figure out who I was and what I cared about.</p>
<p>There was a lot of other stuff, naturally, and lots of stuff we did (and much we really shouldn&rsquo;t have), but suffice it to say that I&rsquo;m really fond of that period in my life. (I like most every period of my life, to tell the truth.)</p>
<p>Okay, so now I think we&rsquo;ve got enough context  to talk about the reunion. There were a small handful of people &ndash; mostly folks from the band, naturally &ndash; who Kathy &amp; I really wanted to see and spend time with, and we were able to do that. It was awesome to see them and the families that they&rsquo;ve built and strengthened over the years. They&rsquo;ve built amazing lives and families and careers, and it was fun just to learn about them. And it was really amazing how comfortable it was, how natural it was.</p>
<p>There were people who we really wanted to see who weren&rsquo;t there &ndash; some must&rsquo;ve just been a few miles away in their homes in San Antonio; others were stymied by 10,000 miles of distance. So that was a bummer.</p>
<p>Lots of people who I used to be good friends with but just didn&rsquo;t recognize until we started talking. There were people there who I totally recognized and gave big hugs to &ndash; only to figure out we didn&rsquo;t actually know each other. Awkward. But okay, really &ndash; the spirit of everyone was great that way.</p>
<p>Some folks were exactly who you&rsquo;d imagine they&rsquo;d be &ndash; they look like you thought they would, they do what you thought they&rsquo;d do. There were others who were completely the opposite.  And there were some who were a little bit of both. Which makes sense &ndash; when I think about myself, I know that there are ways in which I&rsquo;m <em>exactly</em> the same as I was then, and ways that I&rsquo;m a completely different person. Some were easy to predict, some not so much.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s ultimately the lesson &ndash; that there aren&rsquo;t any real lessons. That 20 years on, we&rsquo;ve all done a bunch of things &ndash; some in progress, some finished, some in planning stages &ndash; but this isn&rsquo;t so much a milestone as a continuation of living our lives together &ndash; a bit of a look in at lives in progress. And it seems to me that we&rsquo;re all so different, but still so the same &ndash; like we were in band, trying to become something great, to catch a glimpse of transcendence. The places we look for that are different &ndash; instead of band or football or schoolwork we may work hard to be great at work or to look for transcendence in a quiet dinner with your spouse or in your son&rsquo;s first smile.</p>
<p>But the trying, the striving, seems to me to be the same, and I had a wonderful time sharing our own striving with everyone and hearing and seeing a little bit of theirs.</p>

			 <p>A couple of days ago, I posted something about how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m playing around with @font-face<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and since then have also been experimenting with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TypeKit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I use for the headlines you see here). Generated a bit of discussion, but one of the things I mentioned at the end of my post was a class I took at Stanford 15 years ago called Concepts of Text, and taught by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Charles Bigelow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a well-known font designer &ndash; his foundry did the font family <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lucida<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for example, and the System 7 city fonts, among many, many others.</p>
<p>One of the classes I remember fondly for being a little wacky (and interesting) was when he gave a talk about typographers who were persecuted for the material they were typesetting.</p>
<p>After I posted the other day, Professor Bigelow somehow found the post and gave us a little primer, which I include below because of the high awesomeness quotient. Really made my day - favorite comment ever. :-)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Just in case the names and dates have faded from memory, here’s a brief refresher.</p>
<p>Antoine Augereau, Parisian printer and type designer, reputedly the teacher of Garamond. hanged and burned on Christmas Eve, 1534, on (supposedly trumped up) charges of printing heretical placards.</p>
<p>Etienne Dolet, printer of Lyon and Paris, burned at the stake on August 3, 1546, in Paris, on charges of blasphemy, sedition, and selling prohibited books.</p>
<p>Martin l’Homme, hanged in 1560 for printing a pamphlet against a Cardinal.</p>
<p>That all happened a long time ago, but in the 20th century, Sophie Scholl, among others in the White Rose society, was guillotined on charges of treason, on February 22, 1943, for distributing pamphlets against Nazi genocide on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>I’m sure that somewhere there is good news about printers, too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Then the other day a friend of mine tweeting about the acquisition of Sun by Oracle as another one getting gobbled up by House Harkonnen, which triggered me to reread it.</p>
<p>This time around, I understood a lot more of what the book is about, of course, and enjoyed it just as much. It&rsquo;s a great book, for sure &ndash; although my memory of the rest of the sequels is still good enough that I&rsquo;m not going to ruin the original by re-reading those.</p>
<p>I think the pacing is a little on the slow side &ndash; not really contemporary speed, anyway &ndash; but the idea, and the bigness of the setting are of course amazing, as is the range that Herbert shows, going from huge imperial family intrigue &amp; wars to personal mysticism.</p>
<p>Anyway, definitely worth reading again.</p>

<p>To tell you the truth, I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect 4 summers ago when I started at Mozilla. We were in our (extremely small) space on Villa St; Firefox was taking off; I was quickly learning that the Mozilla-style of doing things did not quite match what I expected. I knew that it was an important project; I knew it had smart, unique leaders; I knew that I didn&rsquo;t understand much about how it could possibly, you know, actually exist.</p>
<p>But it was an undeniably exciting time &ndash; tons of people were using and discovering Firefox &ndash; there were probably something like 20 million users at that time. Firefox 1.5 was nearly finished; Thunderbird 1.5 was on the way. And it just felt like there was a ton of promise and opportunity on the web that hadn&rsquo;t been there a year before.</p>
<p>A couple of months after I started we moved into our current offices at 1981 Landings Drive (pictured above), and in the intervening 4 years, tons and tons has happened. Mozilla has grown, of course &ndash; into a network of community and contributors around the world that create a product that&rsquo;s in more than 70 languages and used by more than 300 million people. But the web itself has gone through an enormous explosion of innovation. When we moved into this office in late 2005 was a time before YouTube became huge (they were just 6 months old) &ndash; and was really before video on the web was meaningful. It was before Facebook was big &ndash; would be another year until they opened up to everyone. And of course it was way before Twitter came on the scene.</p>
<p>And, of course, the world of the browser looks incredibly, impossibly, and wonderfully different today than it did then, with a faster-than-ever Firefox dropping soon, an improved IE8, and Safari, Opera and Chrome each competing and innovating. Oh, and the whole mobile browsing thing happened, too.</p>
<p>In just the four years that we&rsquo;ve been here &ndash; out of the 11 since the Mozilla project started &ndash; the web has been transformed, and has itself transformed so much of the way we live our lives. It&rsquo;s easy to gloss over, since we see the changes every day &ndash; and it&rsquo;s easy to see the road that we&rsquo;ve traveled on as being inevitable &ndash; but it really wasn&rsquo;t. The reason we have a vibrant, open web today is because of millions of little decisions and contributions made by thousands of people in that timeframe &ndash; people who work on browsers, people who build web sites &amp; applications, people who evangelize for standards, people who use the web and ask/demand that it be better.</p>
<p>Leaving this building for our new home at 650 Castro (which, for the eagle-eyed Netscape historian will look familiar) gives me a bit of a chance to reflect on how much our world has changed while we&rsquo;ve been here, as well as the part Mozilla&rsquo;s had in effecting that change.</p>
<p>And I have to say that looking forward, I can&rsquo;t wait to see what the next 4 or 5 years brings, and what we can do from our new home &amp; vantage point. The web continues to be the driver of an unprecedented amount of change, and I don&rsquo;t see that slowing down any time soon.</p>
<p>So as Mitch likes to say: onward.</p>

			 <p>As some of you know, I&rsquo;m on the Board of Library Trustees for the City of Sunnyvale, where I live. Or at least I am for a few more weeks &ndash; my 4 year term ends next month. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed my time on the Board &ndash; I&rsquo;ve contributed a little, learned a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and generally was just more involved in civic government than I had been before. (I heartily recommend getting involved in the running of the city/county/state/country/place/community/neighborhood in which you live. It&rsquo;s important.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I come to the end of my involvement as convinced as ever that public libraries are critically important to our lives as citizens, but also just as convinced that we&rsquo;ll see a massive reinvention in many of the functions that libraries perform.</p>
<p>But that isn&rsquo;t really what I want to write about today &ndash; what I want to talk about instead is the budget work that&rsquo;s going on for the City of Sunnyvale in 2010 &ndash; the topic of our Library Board meeting tonight.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Sunnyvale hired a new city manager, Gary Luebbers, who inherited, like so many other city managers around the country, a government facing massive shortfalls in revenue among other problems. The preamble to his budgetary response for the coming year is fantastic work, and let&rsquo;s start with some of the context:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Any way you cut it, that&rsquo;s a brutal context for any city to deal with &ndash; even a larger city of 100K+ residents like Sunnyvale &ndash; between revenue shortfall &amp; increased expenditure, you&rsquo;re looking at $15-20M a year.</p>
<p>But here' the thing: Sunnyvale, while we&rsquo;ll see cuts, is basically okay because of the extremely conservative and long-range planning that it&rsquo;s done since reinvention in the 70s. We&rsquo;ve got a $36M budget stabilization fund, for example &ndash; and we can draw down on that for a few years &ndash; and because of that, the cash flow interruption from the State doesn&rsquo;t matter overmuch.</p>
<p>I have some concerns about the conservative nature of Sunnyvale city planning &ndash; I think in any normal times it&rsquo;s over-constraining &ndash; but in this particular situation, facing such a brutal and cascading financial meltdown, it&rsquo;s incredibly, incredibly helpful to have this strength, and is a reassuring bulwark against the effects of the broader economy.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
A few weeks ago I took a trip to the East Coast &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t really the best week for me to travel &ndash; there was an awful lot going on at work and at home that I needed to attend to &ndash; but I went to a little town in Connecticut called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New Canaan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because I got the opportunity to participate in something unique &ndash; a Conversation on Transparency at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Philip Johnson&rsquo;s Glass House<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. (New Canaan itself is a place with unusual history, worth checking out.)</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know much about the Glass House or the event or what I was getting into when I signed up &ndash; only that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diego Rodriguez<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who I think quite highly of as a design thinker &amp; friend (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->go read his blog!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), strongly recommended that I participate &ndash; so I did, and I&rsquo;m really glad I did. It was a bit of a different world for me, but gave me much to think about in my own contexts.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to take me a few posts to write this up &ndash; I&rsquo;ll need one for the place/context/history and what the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->National Trust is trying to do<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; will need one for the people &amp; objectives of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conversation Series<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; will probably need another for the ideas that came up. But want to capture some of my thoughts before they flit away, so will start writing. [I started writing this right away, anyway, but now am just getting around to finishing it.]</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Philip Johnson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was a complex guy, for sure. One of the leading architects of the Modernist movement, he&rsquo;s built some of the most influential buildings of the 20th century, from his own residence, the Glass House, to the Seagram Building in NYC, to the Crystal Cathedral. What I didn&rsquo;t know before is that he&rsquo;s known as much for the people he influenced and mentored &ndash; many of whom were probably better architects.</p>
<p>Anyway, he built this house for himself called the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Glass House<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it&rsquo;s exactly what it sounds like &ndash; a house that he lived in for more than 50 years with walls made only of glass.</p>
<p>Building a house that&rsquo;s completely transparent is more than just an architectural statement (and it definitely is a significant architectural statement) &ndash; it&rsquo;s also a personal statement &ndash; a statement of values, of ideals. It&rsquo;s made more interesting by Johnson himself &ndash; among other things, a gay man who had voiced support for Nazi Germany in the 30s (although he later clearly &amp; obviously regretted it and couldn&rsquo;t really even understand it). Think of that. To be a gay man (not openly, but more of an open secret) in mid-20th century America and deciding to build a house that anyone could see right into, and even through. There&rsquo;s a lot to parse in there by people who know a lot more about the human psyche than I do, but right off the bat you can see any number of ideas: idealism, design, openness, exhibitionism, power &ndash; it&rsquo;s a really complicated mix of things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s made more complicated by the fact that the Glass House isn&rsquo;t really a glass house &ndash; or rather, that particular building is made of glass and transparent, but it&rsquo;s situated in a much larger context &ndash; 47 acres of extremely maintained landscape, and something like 19 total buildings that make up, really, a house turned inside out. And the Glass House itself is the only building made of any significant amount of glass. (with the exception of the ceiling of the sculpture museum)</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the Glass House, with a living room, kitchen (although minimal &ndash; they called it more of a martini bar), dining area, bathroom (in the brick column), plus some walnut cabinets in the middle. Made of steel &amp; glass, with a red brick floor.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And the Brick House, made up of a small guest room, bathroom &amp; library &ndash; purposely built to be a little uncomfortable, because he didn&rsquo;t like his friends like Andy Warhol staying for more than a couple of days, as he said &ldquo;guests are like fish, they should only last three days at most.&rdquo; (Same basic dimensions as the Glass House opposite, same elevation &amp; length, but half the width. (There&rsquo;s definitely an optical illusion going on there &ndash; they look roughly similar.) The irony/symmetry/connection/whatever of the Brick House being opposite the Glass House is incredibly compelling.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And the art gallery, buried under a mound, as an homage to an Egyptian tomb for someone who&rsquo;s name I now can&rsquo;t remember. The point that Dorothy Dunn, our guide, made is that it&rsquo;s a great irony for an art collector to build a house where the walls are glass &ndash; no place to hang art! So they built this underground bunker sort of thing, and it can hold a LOT of art for the space &ndash; the works are on a sort of giant rolodex system, so you can rotate in whatever art you want to look at. Mix &amp; match. It was fun to get to look at all the things on the wheels behind the works that were showing.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The sculpture gallery, which is built sort of like a hothouse with a glass ceiling &ndash; and one of the guys who maintains it confirmed that it often feels like a hothouse &ndash; that it&rsquo;s hotter than hell in the summertime. The space of the sculpture gallery is a little difficult to show with 2 dimensional pictures, so I&rsquo;ll include a few, as well a bronze cast that is  outside the front door called Ozymandias. I&rsquo;ll let you draw your own conclusions on that particular statement.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>One of my favorite buildings is his library &ndash; easily 100-200 yards away from the main house &ndash; and with a funny sort of shape. But it must have been a cozy place to read and work.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Right near the library, there&rsquo;s the Ghost House &ndash; a primitive archetype of a house, really &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s really for other than just, you know, looking like a house.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Out on the grounds there are a number of other things &ndash; at the front gate, there&rsquo;s a place for receiving people that we didn&rsquo;t spend much time near.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little man-made lake with a sort of terrace &ndash; hard to really make sense of this, since it seems to have been built on a smaller scale, for effect &ndash; but you can see from my pictures that if you&rsquo;re at all taller than me, you had to duck down a bit to be inside.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And a cinder block statue that didn&rsquo;t make a ton of sense to me &ndash; except that it made sense when viewed from the Glass House itself, which I think is part of the point &ndash; a lot of the space was designed for experiencing from particular points of view, with the inside of the house being the most important one.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Even the grounds themselves were very manicured and varied, with streams, lots of different textures of foliage, etc.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Make no mistake: this is a beautiful &amp; wondrous place. It&rsquo;s not remotely like any other place I&rsquo;ve been or heard of, and it&rsquo;s amazing. I felt lucky to get a chance to go (tours are booked a year or so in advance, but the access that we got was more than a tour &ndash; it was total access, really). I also felt very lucky to get a chance to participate in the discussion on transparency &ndash; more on that, plus some more interior (such as it is) photos when I get a few more minutes to write.</p>

			 <p>This week we had about 250 employees &amp; contractors from across Mozilla-land out to Mountain View for an all hands meeting. It was a great week, full of interesting conversations with people who are really dedicated to changing the world and making the web a better place. Super generative; sometimes contentious; always earnest &amp; dedicated &amp; thoughtful.</p>
<p>I gave a talk &amp; had a conversation to start the week off &ndash; I wanted to talk about some of the context that we find ourselves in now and how we can think about becoming a longer term organization, now that Mozilla&rsquo;s first 11 years are behind us. I focused on the tension between what I&rsquo;ve come to call Poetry &amp; Pragmatics. The pragmatics of an organization are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you do things; the poetry of an organization is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you do them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big difference; they&rsquo;re both important, and sometimes they amplify each other, sometimes they conflict. Getting the balance right, from day to day, from year to year &ndash; that&rsquo;s the thing that great organizations do over time, and it&rsquo;s what we need to always think about how to do better.</p>
<p>I also talked a bit about how we&rsquo;re going to need to change going forward, adjust to new circumstances, avoid holding onto outdated ways of thinking, try new things.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I&rsquo;ll attach my slides from that talk here &ndash; it&rsquo;s a bit of an experiment for me to post what&rsquo;s essentially an internal talk &ndash; lots of context missing, lots to misconstrue &ndash; but I really believe in the content and so figured I&rsquo;d try sharing. :-) See what you think.</p>

<p>Next week I&rsquo;m traveling to New York to participate in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->conversation at the Philip Johnson Glass House<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; it&rsquo;s a sort of design+culture+art salon where a number of leaders talk about various topics and seek to understand and act as catalysts for new sorts of action.</p>
<p>I was invited after an introduction from my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diego<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who attended a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Maeda-led Conversation last year on Simplicity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; Diego reports that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his experience there was incredible and thought-provoking<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Our conversation will be moderated by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cliff Pearson of Architectural Record<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, tackling the topic of &ldquo;Transparency.&rdquo; Many of the participants look to be design &amp; architectural &ndash; it looks like I&rsquo;m the lone Left Coast/tech nerd representative. (Think they&rsquo;ll be surprised when I tweet from our session in the spirit of transparency? :-))</p>
<p>In that spirit, wanted to blog with some links before I went, and ask you what you think is important to talk about in the context of transparency in our modern society? Transparency of organizations (like companies and governments)? Transparency of products (like open source)? Transparency of thoughts? Action? Buildings? What aspects of transparency deserve more thought &amp; attention &amp; discourse?</p>

			 <p>Mike Beltzner and I had a neat experience today &ndash; we got to give a talk at Stanford&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CS547<!-- raw HTML omitted --> class on how we do design at scale at Mozilla, with Firefox in particular. It was a nostalgic and humbling experience for me &ndash; revisiting a set of experiences that significantly changed my life.

<p>A friend, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sean White<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, kept telling me I should look at Human Computer Interaction &ndash; I eventually did, and got involved with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->curriculum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Terry Winograd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was creating at Stanford, I helped TA for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bill Verplank<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mitch Kapor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and just generally found the thing that I really, really loved to do, which was try to build computing systems that made sense to people and made them generally happier and more productive. These people are huge in my history, and in the field &ndash; they invented so much of what we think of now as software design &ndash; I feel incredibly lucky that Sean encouraged me to follow that path, and incredibly lucky to have been at Stanford at that time.</p>
<p>So when Professor Winograd asked if I&rsquo;d like to give a talk at 547, I of course said yes. CS547 is a seminar course that has been a who&rsquo;s who of people doing amazing work in design &ndash; the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->list of speakers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over the past 15 is truly unbelievable &ndash; people who have made real and massive differences in making computing (and the Internet) more accessible, useful, and joyful for people around the world.</p>
<p>As we got closer to the event, I got more reflective on the path that I&rsquo;ve taken from there to here; the choices that have led me to be more interested in how to help more people do design &ndash; to help more people participate and engage and change their world &ndash; and how Mozilla represents such a natural point on that path. And of course that made me more self-conscious than ever about speaking in this forum &ndash; it&rsquo;s a small class, but the history and the implications are not.</p>
<p>I was touched that Bill Verplank came by &ndash; and happy to get a chance to talk with him, 15 years after being his teaching assistant. And I have to say that I was shocked as I heard myself talk &ndash; how many of the ideas that I use today, in 2009, I realized came out of our interactions back then.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was happy to get the chance to talk, in this storied forum, and extremely humbled. And very proud to give the talk with Mike Beltzner, one of my very favorite collaborators and co-thinkers on design. I&rsquo;ll put the slides below, and you can see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->video of the talk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well (link is at the bottom of the page &ndash; sorry for the WMV!)</p>

			 <p>I was pretty sure that the iPhone Kindle app would be sort of neat, but not ultimately very useful. After a week with it, I will say this: I was wrong. It&rsquo;s important, and is already changing my relationship with the books that I read.</p>
<p>To start with, a few pieces of context. I&rsquo;ve had the first generation Kindle since it came out; got the 2nd generation Kindle (verdict: betterish) when it came out &ndash; so now my wife &amp; I are each reading on a Kindle. And we use 1st &amp; 2nd generation iPhones as well. We have a lot of screens. It&rsquo;s a little ridiculous.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve read maybe 50 books on Kindles now &ndash; I probably do about half of my book reading on the Kindle. (And none of my newsreading, which is 100% web; and very little of my magazine reading &ndash; but The New Yorker on Kindle is growing on me quickly now &ndash; suspect The Atlantic won&rsquo;t be far behind.)</p>
<p>And so the first thing you need to know about all the various Kindle reviews on the web is this: throw them all out. People read differently &ndash; everyone is unique in their relationship to (especially) long form writing &ndash; what we usually call books. Many, many reviewers on the web have been reviewing the Kindle like they&rsquo;d review a new laptop or a new cell phone &ndash; pick it up, play with the features, make some conclusions &amp; write them up. But I&rsquo;d wager that a very high percentage of these reviewers don&rsquo;t read that many long form books, and wrote their reviews, in order to be timely, before they&rsquo;d really spent much reading time, let alone notetaking, highlighting, etc. That makes a real difference, and I think makes most reviews very very suspect.</p>
<p>When you get time with the Kindle to read longer books, you realize the reflective nature of the eInk page, while far from perfect, is much better for reading lots of pages than an LCD screen is &ndash; way easier on your eyes, much more natural feeling. And while everyone wants to touch the text, I think a touch screen is not actually ideal for reading &ndash; smudges will be brutal &ndash; especially for a non-backlit screen.</p>
<p>So while I was early to try the iPhone app, I was pretty dismissive of it &ndash; didn&rsquo;t think I would use it at all.</p>
<p>But I have, a lot, and it&rsquo;s changing the way I think about my books. I&rsquo;ve found myself reading more when out &amp; about &ndash; while waiting for my oil change the other day, in between meetings while traveling, etc &ndash; all on the iPhone. Because my books are synced &ndash; so I have my content with me all the time, and know what page I&rsquo;m on all the time &ndash; it&rsquo;s easier to read them because I&rsquo;m more likely to have them with me, in one form or another. Which means that I&rsquo;ve been keeping the threads of each book more present in my head, which tends to reinforce my desire to read more, as opposed to alternative timewasting activities (especially when traveling) like news reading, video watching, or iPhone Yahtzee playing (I&rsquo;m addicted, a little, but I could totally stop any time I wanted to.)</p>
<p>So this is sort of a shocking development for me: the iPhone Kindle + physical Kindle + library of books in the cloud is actually extending my attention span and increasing my reading, which has been on the decline for the past few years. It&rsquo;s making me want all my books to be cloud-accessible and sharable with Kathy&rsquo;s Kindle, too (not to mention others in my friends &amp; family circles). The ability to view notes on the iPhone means that I can blog books with quotes even without the Kindle, which was a challenge before.</p>
<p>And so it makes me want to have my long form reading content + notes available &amp; searchable on my laptop as well, naturally.</p>
<p>So you can see where things are heading: the utility of having ubiquitous access to content will ultimately trump the old forms. There&rsquo;s no going back. I said it when I first got my Kindle, and it remains truer than ever: I thought that it was books that I really loved &ndash; but I was wrong &ndash; it&rsquo;s reading longer form articles &amp; stories &amp; novels &amp; histories &ndash; it&rsquo;s the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->words<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ideas<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->flow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I really love.</p>
<p>Happily, the Kindle ecosystem reinforces that feeling a ton &ndash; surprised &amp; pleased.</p>
<p>[and yes, the DRM is killing me. it really gets in the way of legitimate book-type sharing. i really don&rsquo;t like the closed nature of the system. but i think, like music, that this will fall over time.]</p>

			 <p>installed Kindle app on iPhone; have downloaded some of my books &amp; synced to furthest page read. it&rsquo;s neat. predictably, not as good a reading experience as on Kindle by a mile. pretty marginal bookmarking, no notes, search, etc. so really underpowered.</p>
<p>but i think useful if i&rsquo;m somewhere and forgot my Kindle, absolutely, and i&rsquo;m sure that i&rsquo;ll buy books with it to read a snippet then really read on my Kindle.</p>
<p>expect this to cause them a real spike, then things will settle down. really needs a lot more functionality; and the reading experience will never be anywhere near as good.</p>
<p>but a solid &amp; useful complement.</p>

			 <p>All the awesomeness fuses in my brain are blown from sheer overload of the awesome, so not sure I&rsquo;ll be super-coherent tonight &ndash; will post more through the week about a bunch of different &amp; great insights from TED.</p>
<p>For now, I want to capture this one thing: on both a personal and professional level, TED is amazing and transformative. It&rsquo;s chic to be sort of cynical about the conference circuit, glib about how you&rsquo;ve seen things like this before. But it&rsquo;s not appropriate in this case. I feel that virtually every interaction &amp; talk over the past 3 days has made me want to become better at what I do, and to do more to change the world we live in as well. It&rsquo;s made me want to do more at Mozilla, but beyond that to be a more present and thoughtful human, husband and father.</p>
<p>Because my first experience at TED has been one where being smart is cool, where using data is obviously the right way to do things, where science rules, where art transforms. It makes me think harder about what to do at work to have a greater impact, and what to do at home to be a better family member.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as good an event as I&rsquo;ve ever been to, and especially with all the cynicism in our world today, I think it&rsquo;s important to note TED as a force that promotes education, science, and art as a way to improve the world.</p>
<p>More soon, as my brain recovers.</p>
<p>ps - everyone here uses Firefox. :-)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still getting used to the rhythms of our new government &ndash; the pace of the first two weeks has been amazing. Not without stumbles, but I&rsquo;m incredibly encouraged. In particular, I find that I follow and read Obama&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Executive Orders and Presidential Memoranda<!-- raw HTML omitted --> every day or two.</p>
<p>The fact that they&rsquo;re available (and easy to find) along with a lot of other information on whitehouse.gov is fantastic and incredibly meaningful. But the content is also incredible so far, and in particular one specific memo titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Freedom of Information Act<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful and clear piece of writing, and states some incredibly important principles of operation and standards of behavior that I hope our agencies can live up to. The memo speaks for itself, so I&rsquo;ll quote several passages at some length.</p>

			 <p>It is about 1000 times happier traveling as an American this year than it has been in the past 6 or so. I feel like we&rsquo;re all still getting used to the new administration &ndash; and it&rsquo;s clear that the rest of the world is, too. Here in Europe, I found people to be very curious about the new government, and sort of blown away, in particular, by the level of engagement and openness and participation that Obama&rsquo;s team has put in place so quickly. I heard, more than one time, that there was no other place in the world where something like this would have happened quite this way &ndash; not just in the sense of electing a minority candidate, but more in the sense of the speed in which our government is working to give control back to the people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of road left to travel yet &ndash; they&rsquo;ve barely started &ndash; but already it&rsquo;s clear that people everywhere are watching &amp; thinking, and are ready to give Obama &ndash; and by extension Americans &ndash; some benefit of the doubt again.</p>

<p>One of my favorite &amp; most thoughtful writers on China writes a great framing piece for the new administration. Great suggestions.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Larry<!-- raw HTML omitted --> already pointed this out, but IBM CEO <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sam Palmisano&rsquo;s Op-Ed in today&rsquo;s Wall Street Journal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is incredibly important and spot on. There&rsquo;s incredible pressure now to create jobs, to get money flowing &ndash; however possible. And it&rsquo;s important for sure. But the situation we&rsquo;re in now means that we have an opportunity to make investments that can not just fix the short term, but change our attitudes, our processes, our approach.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hopeful that like so many other positive signals from the transition government so far, that we&rsquo;ll use this economic stimulus as a way not just to fix today&rsquo;s (undoubtedly painful) problems, but to invest in structural changes that will make life better a generation from now.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago I ran in the San Jose Rock &amp; Roll Half Marathon for the 2nd year. Ran in 1:49:40, which was about 2 minutes better than last year&rsquo;s time, broke 1:50 (which was a goal), and fell a little short of my 1:47ish target. I have a bunch of things to work on &ndash; some mistakes that I made &ndash; but on the whole, am really happy with the effort, and that I was able to compete at all. </p>
<p>I have a fair number of insights into my own performance and psyche that will probably be of limited interest to anyone but me, but want to capture them before they&rsquo;re lost and I get too much back into my normal routine. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why: I&rsquo;ve never exactly been what you&rsquo;d call an athlete. I played soccer some when I was very young, but really mostly focused on other stuff (grist for another cathartic post sometime, maybe). I didn&rsquo;t really learn to play basketball until college, and I didn&rsquo;t start exercising regularly until right around the time I turned 30. (co-incident with my first startup, Reactivity, and the body shape that comes from working all the time.) So for the past several years, I&rsquo;ve learned how to lift, how to do some aerobics. That all got a lot better, even, when I left Reactivity and took 6 months off &ndash; I managed to get to the gym most days, learned how to run a little bit, lost some weight.</p>
<p>Last year, I was really unsure how I&rsquo;d do, and ended up doing great. Very consistent each of the 13 miles &ndash; between 8:27 and 8:31 each mile. So not all that fast, but very very consistent. And looking back on it, it was a very mental race for me. I was mostly in my head the whole race, thinking about a lot of different things, and it was great. (My brain tends to have non-linear thoughts when I run, connecting lots of things that I don&rsquo;t usually connect, and generally being more generative than usual.) This year, though, was a bit of a crapshoot. My back had been giving me trouble the couple of months before, and I was unsure until race day whether I would run at all. I&rsquo;ve had back trouble dating back to 2004 or so &ndash; I&rsquo;m pretty convinced it was the 200k miles I flew that year (all domestic!) for Reactivity. It had been doing better, but had a real setback around August. I have a feeling that this time around it came from a combination of gaining weight, running too much, and not taking care of my core strength.</p>
<p>Anyway, the race this time, even though it was a bit faster, was not mental at all &ndash; it was just a physical grind. I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could make it at all, and ended up walking some in the last mile &ndash; otherwise I think I could have done right around 1:48, or maybe better. While I didn&rsquo;t find the physical grind type of race as fun to do, I am immensely proud of it &ndash; really, truly, I was having trouble walking the days leading up to the race, and I just wasn&rsquo;t at all sure I could get the first mile done. So that was really great. </p>
<p>I think the 2nd contributing factor is that this year, because I knew I could run faster than I knew last year, I was in a faster starting group, nearer to the front of the race. That had 2 implications. First, I started off faster than I probably should have, because I paced like the runners around me. Second, as I started to slow down around 8 miles, people started to pass me, and I think that was damaging to my psyche &amp; motivation. I&rsquo;ve noted elsewhere that I seem to run better from behind &ndash; when I&rsquo;m chasing after someone else &ndash; it&rsquo;s a little demoralizing to me to watch people pass me.</p>
<p>So anyway, I learned a lot this time around &ndash; both in the specific race and in comparison to last year&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll definitely do one next year &ndash; and probably 2 if I can find one that I like. In the meantime, though, I&rsquo;m spending a ton of time working on my core strength, and my glutes &amp; hips, and not really focusing on my running at all until sometime in the new year. Working with a trainer has helped me to figure out that I am like the opposite of flexible in my legs &ndash; I seem to live my whole life without actually bending my knees. Surprising. :-)</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll work on that for a while, then work on my running again. And I hope to be writing in 6 months or a year about how I accomplished some new things, but have figured out some others that I want to work on. I&rsquo;ve mentioned this to a lot of folks, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Murakami&rsquo;s book on running<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been really influential for me this year. He talks a lot about how his running reminds him that he&rsquo;s an imperfect man living an imperfect life &ndash; and how that&rsquo;s life-affirming for him. That really resonates for me, and I think it&rsquo;s why running is really helping me understand myself, even though I&rsquo;m not particularly good at it, and have found it relatively late in life. </p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m proud of the result, and wanted to capture the reflections. Meant to write this 2 months ago, but it&rsquo;s been a busy time. Looking forward to writing the next one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That&rsquo;s a picture of my WoW character, Frink. For the uninitiated, that&rsquo;s not what he&rsquo;s supposed to look like &ndash; in general, characters in the game wear, you know, clothes. But this is what he looked like a few weeks back, after someone somehow hijacked my account and stole all Frink&rsquo;s stuff. Pretty much back to normal at this point, after the Blizzard folks restored Frink&rsquo;s gear, but was a very weird experience. In case anyone&rsquo;s interested, getting stolen from in an online world feels pretty much like it does in the real world. You have a sense of being taken advantage of that&rsquo;s not good at all. </p>
<p>But so far at least, the &ldquo;undo&rdquo; aspect of online makes everything better. Would have been a lot worse with something not undoable&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Briefly, then gotta get started on working in an abbreviated Thanksgiving week&hellip;</p>
<p>Every so often I find myself in a situation with family or work and realize that something&rsquo;s different, something&rsquo;s new &ndash; and I try to take myself out of the moment a little bit to notice it.</p>
<p>This morning at the breakfast table, as I was packing up and getting ready to head into work, I was half-listening to SPL and his babysitter &ndash; they were talking in Mandarin to each other &ndash; but when I looked up, the subject matter was one of my own books from when I was a kid: Richard Scarry&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Busytown<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And that caused me to think about how many of the little vignettes of our morning were incredibly traditional, but also incredibly modern.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kathy &amp; I had already read the morning&rsquo;s news &ndash; but me from my laptop news reader and Kathy was scanning through on her iPhone &ndash; we haven&rsquo;t gotten a daily or weekly newspaper for probably 10 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We were all dressed appropriately for the weather &ndash; but not because of information in the paper or the morning TV news, but over the Web, naturally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SPL &amp; his babysitter, reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Busytown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but talking about it in Mandarin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, today felt like a rich combination of new and old to me &ndash; and, really, something that felt very California modern. I have a sense/hope that 20 years from now the differences will be not so much about information usage but about materials and energy usage. We&rsquo;ll see, I suppose.</p>

<p>It boggles my mind a little bit, though, to look around the hall and think about what these hundreds of kids will be like, how they&rsquo;ll contribute to the world, how different their world will be from the one we grew up with.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Along with (I think), thousands of Stanford alums, yesterday in my in box I found an extraordinary letter from John Hennessy, Stanford&rsquo;s President (and a wonderful CS professor and entrepreneur) about the current economic situation and the implications for Stanford. The letter speaks for itself, I think, but I&rsquo;ll preface it by noting a few things. First, John&rsquo;s proactive &amp; candid openness is incredible and wonderful to me. Happily, there seems to be a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot of that going around lately<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Second, the economic situation is very bad, expanding, and touching everyone. It&rsquo;s going to get much worse.</p>
<p>Still, I can&rsquo;t help but feel like we&rsquo;re all developing ways to talk about challenges like a community of adults, whether they be in commercial terms like we have at Mozilla, in the academy like this note, or in our government with the new administration. That&rsquo;s something we can build on.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Alumni, Parents and Friends:</p>
<p>Many of you have contacted me over the past few months with questions about the recent shifts in the economy and how the University is affected. I would like to update you on our response to these challenges.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Financial Aid Commitments Still Secure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The questions came to me even before the academic year was under way, from parents moving their sons and daughters into their residences this past fall: Given the state of the economy, would the University be able to meet its commitments to financial aid? Would we be able to help in situations where decreased home equity might preclude a loan they were counting on to help pay tuition? How would we deal with job losses by a family member? Our response: We will stand by our commitments and, yes, we will reconsider the financial aid needs of any family negatively impacted by the economic downturn.</p>
<p>The questions continued through Reunion Homecoming Weekend as the Dow Jones average dropped approximately 25 percent further. How was the University&rsquo;s endowment affected? What would this mean for financial aid, for operations and for the capital facilities projects already under way?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The Tightest Financial Outlook in Decades<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Let&rsquo;s start with the endowment. We weathered the period through early summer comparatively well, achieving an overall return of 6.2 percent for the year ending June 30, 2008. Since then, the endowment has declined steeply, although somewhat less precipitously than the market indices. In addition, sponsored research, our second largest revenue source, has been declining in real terms over the past several years, and given the challenges in the federal budget is unlikely to improve quickly. Tuition, our third major source of revenue, cannot be raised significantly out of fairness to our students and their families. All of these factors contribute to the tightest financial outlook we have seen in decades.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Stanford entered this period in a relatively healthy financial position, bolstered by several years of revenue increases, generous gifts from alumni, parents and friends, and remarkable growth in the endowment, which for the first time ever became the University&rsquo;s largest source of revenue.</p>
<p>To manage our finances going forward, we anticipate reducing the $800 million general funds budget - which pays for most of our faculty and staff salaries, central administrative operations and non-research expenses - by 10 to 12 percent over the next few years. Declining federal research dollars could double the total revenue loss across the University. We cannot achieve these reductions without some significant and permanent cutbacks.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cutting Costs Wisely<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
As we implement these budget cuts, we will do so with several principles in mind. First, we will focus on preserving the investments we have made in our faculty over the past decade. Likewise, we will maintain our commitment to both undergraduate and graduate students. The excellence of the University depends on its people, and we will do our best to maintain the quality of our faculty, staff and students as we make adjustments.</p>
<p>Second, we will review our capital projects. We are in the midst of a major capital program that includes some vital construction projects. Halting projects in mid-construction, even temporarily, would cost us more money in the long run. But not all our projects will be built according to the original schedule. We will reexamine projects that incur significant amounts of debt.</p>
<p>Third, through support from The Stanford Challenge we have launched a variety of efforts to address the most challenging problems facing humankind: sustaining our planet for future generations, enhancing peace and stability around the world, exploring the potential of stem cells for autoimmune diseases, improving K-12 education in the United States, and finding new ways to generate energy that will not increase greenhouse gases. These are critical initiatives, and while we must adapt our efforts to present circumstances, we will not shy away from our long-term responsibility to lead in finding solutions for these problems.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trust in Our Stanford Community<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We know we are not alone in dealing with this financial shockwave; some of you will experience situations far more difficult than we see on our campus. My sincere wish is that those whose lives have been disrupted will find firmer footing in coming months. In any crisis, we look to the people and places whose connections sustain and strengthen us. I hope that your place in the Stanford community provides such nourishment for you.</p>
<p>As always, I am happy to hear from you. Send your comment, suggestion or question to me at <a href="mailto:president@stanford.edu">president@stanford.edu</a> or to Howard E. Wolf, &lsquo;80, vice president for alumni affairs and president of Stanford Alumni Association, at <a href="mailto:alumnipresident@stanford.edu">alumnipresident@stanford.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>John L. Hennessy
President</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had the good fortune to visit the Stanford CS department twice this week &ndash; on Monday I visited with some of the current section leaders to talk about Mozilla some, and last night I was on a CS careers panel with my very good friends Schrep &amp; Mauria and got to see Mehran &amp; Jay as an added bonus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been interesting to be back &ndash; both incredibly familiar and pretty foreign to me. [As an aside, I have different feelings when I engage with the d.school &ndash; I think maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve gotten more involved with Diego &amp; Bob &amp; George and design later in my life, and am increasingly interested in those sorts of problems &ndash; so I associate undergraduate CS education at Stanford with some exceptionally strong (and fond) emotions that come along with growing up in college.]</p>
<p>On the incredibly familiar side, I understood all the language; I recognized section leaders pulling a huge stack of papers out of their bags; using the time before the class to grade those programs; talking about whether something deserved a &ldquo;check&rdquo; or a &ldquo;check plus.&rdquo; I recognized the tiredness that comes from going all the time, but also the common fun &amp; shared interest of the section leaders. And while I guess my time at Stanford pre-dated Joss Whedon, I even recognized the feeling when they all started talking about how much they love Dr. Horrible. And of course, of course, I remember looking forward and wondering what life in the world was going to look like, how I was gonna convince someone to give me a job I probably wasn&rsquo;t really qualified for, and, really, what the hell people at work did with all their time.</p>
<p>On the unfamiliar side, holy cow these students know so much today, about so many things that are important. In 1995 when Bryan and I were both getting ready to start at Trilogy, I think we had a pretty good idea of what companies like Apple and Intel and HP did, but beyond that, not so much. But the students I talked with yesterday &amp; Monday are incredibly informed. They understand the differences between Firefox &amp; Chrome &amp; Safari &amp; IE, and even the implications of those differences. They understand how the Facebook platform works &ndash; many have written Facebook apps or web apps that are already in the world. And they understand more than I would have imagined about open source, which makes me hugely optimistic.</p>
<p>They asked lots of great questions. Some were super-specific, about things like what we&rsquo;re going to do with Ubiquity over the next year, how we think about competition with Chrome, what it is, exactly that product managers do. (That last question I told them they&rsquo;ll be asking for a pretty long time.)</p>
<p>But also things like how to decide what job to take? How to measure success? How much risk should I take right now? Does it matter if I do systems or AI or HCI?</p>
<p>And, of course, all of us older folks on the panel found ourselves saying things like &ldquo;well, you won&rsquo;t really get this now, but&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;it took me 3 jobs to really figure out anything about that&rdquo;. But the coolest thing, really, was that everyone on the panel agreed that the single most important thing was to not over-think it, to do what makes you engaged and interested &ndash; to do, in Tom Kosnik&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;things that make your soul sing.&rdquo; And more importantly, to do things that matter to people, that change the world, that make things better. And even with all the economic doom around (more on that in my next post), that message of small groups of people getting together to change the world really resonated and made sense.</p>
<p>So with distance now, some things are clearer, some things not so much &ndash; that&rsquo;s a characteristic of being human, I suppose. But I&rsquo;m excited about this next group of people who are ready to change the world.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been involved with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OSAF<!-- raw HTML omitted --> since before its inception &ndash; my relationship with Mitch (and his investment in Reactivity) led us to collborate on a bunch of different things (and to become close friends), and building a new, modern sort of PIM was one of them. So over the years, I&rsquo;ve been on the Board of Directors, helped with some thinking and recruiting, things like that.</p>
<p>Sheila&rsquo;s got a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new post up about changes to OSAF<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; and the move to a mostly volunteer organization. As part of the transition, it&rsquo;s made sense for Mitchell, Katie and myself to step off the board, and to bring in some exceptionally interesting and talented new members.</p>
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, the results of the last few years at OSAF have been mixed &ndash; with significant contributions coming in the areas of CalDAV (yay!), and thinking about user interface for task management &ndash; but without as much implemented as everyone would have liked. For the record, the chronicling of the project in <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dreaming in Code<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, was not, it seemed to me, quite fair or accurate, and I feel that there were significant missed conclusions in it.</p>
<p>The recent 1.0 release is significant and has many diehard users.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to have been associated with OSAF and the leadership there, including Al, Mitch, Katie, Sheila and many others, and I&rsquo;m happy that there&rsquo;s a new, stronger board in place to be stewards going forward. I&rsquo;m looking forward to watching what comes next. Congrats to Sheila, Jared, Andre, Alex &amp; Eugene!</p>

<p>A few months back, my grandfather Monte (my mom&rsquo;s father) and his wife Myra came to visit us here. (From now on, though, I&rsquo;ll call him &ldquo;Bampa,&rdquo; which I named him back about a million years ago.) This was no small feat &ndash; they rode Amtrak out from Georgia &ndash; up through Washington, DC, over to Chicago, down to Austin to spend a few days with my brother&rsquo;s family, and then west all the way to Los Angeles, where I picked them up. I&rsquo;d been looking forward to spending time with them, and had been meaning to have Bampa tell me more about his life. He&rsquo;s led an interesting life, growing up mostly in Washington State, but really moving around a lot, was a GI in WWII, got his engineering degree at Georgia Tech, worked at Bethlehem Steel in Baltimore in the 50s, in the rocket engineering field in the 50s &amp; 60s, and eventually settling down for good in St. Simons Island &amp; Brunswick, GA, where they live now, and he&rsquo;s still a practicing civil engineer, at 85 years old. He&rsquo;s also the person who was most influential in convincing me to apply to Stanford for college, and that&rsquo;s had obvious &amp; far-reaching implications for my career and life.</p>
<p>So we were touched and excited that Bampa &amp; Myra went to such an effort to visit David&rsquo;s family and then ours. It&rsquo;s one thing to go visit your family; it&rsquo;s another to be able to share with them some part of your own adult life, and learn about theirs in kind. My dad&rsquo;s parents both passed away before I had really established much of my own life; my mom&rsquo;s mother is past the point of being able to travel out to California (although she did when Kathy &amp; I were married in 2000, which I&rsquo;m grateful for). Sometimes I feel very distant out here on the left coast. Most of both Kathy&rsquo;s &amp; my family live so far east of here: my brother in Austin, Kathy&rsquo;s folks in San Antonio, my parents in Nashville and Atlanta, most of my extended family in Georgia. Being able to share some of it when our parents visit is wonderful &ndash; and it was great to be able to share some with Bampa.</p>
<p>On the drive up, we drove along the coast for a while, then inland &ndash; and drove by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Camp Roberts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where Bampa was actually stationed in the 1940s, and he told us some stories about that. Yet another reminder that we all walk an earth that&rsquo;s been traveled much before us.</p>
<p>The whole week was wonderful. We spent an afternoon at Stanford &ndash; sat in on a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->d.school<!-- raw HTML omitted --> class that I helped with (a tiny, tiny bit). It was projects that had a real focus on Facebook &ndash; not sure Bampa totally got it, but he understood the design process very well &ndash; recognized it from his own experience &ndash; which was great. We spent time in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marin Headlands<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (beautiful as always). We went to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Monterey Bay Aquarium<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (top five favorite places anywhere). Had a just-about-perfect Italian dinner in North Beach. Couldn&rsquo;t have been better, really.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t really anticipate is how it felt to see things simultaneously through Bampa&rsquo;s 80+ year old eyes and through SPL&rsquo;s 3 year old eyes. Old &amp; new, experiencing the same things. Just a reminder that the world is both incredibly modern in many ways, and the same as it&rsquo;s ever been in so many others. It was just a really good time we all had together, and was great to share it with family.</p>

			 <p>Hopefully by now you&rsquo;ve caught the news that we&rsquo;re lucky enough to count <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ben<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, founders of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ajaxian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as the newest additions here at Mozilla &ndash; here to start a new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Developer Tools Lab<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They&rsquo;re fired up &amp; ready to go &ndash; so many ideas that should result in modern and open Web development getting easier and easier. I&rsquo;m really excited about what they&rsquo;re up to, and every time I talk with either of them, I&rsquo;m personally incredibly excited about our future here.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I wanted to share that last month we made Chris Beard our Chief Innovation Officer, a new position for Mozilla. Chris has been involved at Mozilla since before the Firefox 1.0 release, leading our marketing and product strategy through Firefox 2, and always seems to be integral to some of the most interesting work we&rsquo;re doing. For the last year or so, he&rsquo;s been building <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Labs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> into something that&rsquo;s generating a lot of good ideas and energy around the future. Last month we moved the Evangelism group to Chris' area of responsibility (with specific management there by long-time Mozillan <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris Blizzard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). And today we created the new Developer Tools Lab.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally in keeping with Mozilla&rsquo;s style that innovation focuses not just on internal breakthroughs but on communications and tools that help everyone innovate, and there&rsquo;s nobody better than Chris at thinking and operating like that. On a personal level, I&rsquo;m always challenged by Chris' thinking and innovation, and am super happy to get to work with him every day. Congratulations, Chris!</p>

			 <p>Interesting developments in the browser world lately. Between the new beta of IE8 and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google releasing the beta of their new browser (called &ldquo;Chrome&rdquo;)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mention<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->work<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by the Mozilla team here as well, there&rsquo;s as much happening as I can ever remember. Let&rsquo;s start from there: more smart people thinking about ways to make the Web good for normal human beings is good, absolutely. Competition often results in innovation of one sort or another &ndash; in the browser you can see that this is true in spades this year, with huge Javascript performance increases, security process advances, and user interface breakthroughs. I&rsquo;d expect that to continue now that Google has thrown their hat in the ring.</p>
<p>It should come as no real surprise that Google has done something here &ndash; their business <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the web, and they&rsquo;ve got clear opinions on how things should be, and smart people thinking about how to make things better. Chrome will be a browser optimized for the things that they see as important, and it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how it evolves.</p>
<p>Having said that, it&rsquo;s worth addressing a couple of questions that folks will no doubt have.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. How does this affect Mozilla?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> As much as anything else, it&rsquo;ll mean there&rsquo;s another interesting browser that users can choose. With IE, Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc &ndash; there&rsquo;s been competition for a while now, and this increases that. So it means that more than ever, we need to build software that people care about and love. Firefox is good now, and will keep on getting better.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. What does this mean for Mozilla&rsquo;s relationship with Google?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Mozilla and Google have always been different organizations, with different missions, reasons for existing, and ways of doing things. I think both organizations have done much over the last few years to improve and open the Web, and we&rsquo;ve had very good collaborations that include the technical, product, and financial. On the technical side of things, we&rsquo;ve collaborated most recently on Breakpad, the system we use for crash reports &ndash; stuff like that will continue. On the product front, we&rsquo;ve worked with them to implement best-in-class anti-phishing and anti-malware that we&rsquo;ve built into Firefox, and looks like they&rsquo;re building into Chrome. On the financial front, as has been reported lately, we&rsquo;ve just renewed our economic arrangement with them through November 2011, which means a lot for our ability to continue to invest in Firefox and in new things like mobile and services.</p>
<p>So all those aligned efforts should continue. And similarly, the parts where we&rsquo;re different, with different missions, will continue to be separate. Mozilla&rsquo;s mission is to keep the Web open and participatory &ndash; so, uniquely in this market, we&rsquo;re a public-benefit, non-profit group (Mozilla Corporation is wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation) with no other agenda or profit motive at all. We&rsquo;ll continue to be that way, we&rsquo;ll continue to develop our products &amp; technology in an open, community-based, collaborative way.</p>
<p>With that backdrop, it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what happens over the coming months and years. I personally think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is an incredibly great browser &ndash; the best anywhere &ndash; and we&rsquo;re seeing millions of people start using it every month. It&rsquo;s based on technology that shows incredible compatibility across the broad web &ndash; technology that&rsquo;s been tweaked and improved over a period of years.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got a truckload of great stuff queued up for Firefox 3.1 and beyond &ndash; things like open video and an amazing next-generation Javascript engine (TraceMonkey) for 3.1, to name a couple. And beyond that, lots of breakthroughs like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Weave<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ubiquity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and Firefox Mobile. And even more that are unpredictable &ndash; the strength of Mozilla has always come from the community that&rsquo;s built it, from core code to the thousands of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extensions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are available for Firefox.</p>
<p>So even in a more competitive environment than ever, I&rsquo;m very optimistic about the future of Mozilla and the future of the open Web.</p>

			 <p>I wasn&rsquo;t too excited about the first couple of episodes of Mad Men this season, but finally caught up this weekend, and I&rsquo;m really, really, really liking it a lot. I think what&rsquo;s really grown on me is how much of what happens on the show isn&rsquo;t on camera &ndash; it&rsquo;s implied, or happens in the characters' heads. There&rsquo;s a ton that the team isn&rsquo;t making explicit, isn&rsquo;t doing some sort of corny exposition of, isn&rsquo;t condescending to viewers. As a result, I think it&rsquo;s really capturing a lot of what it&rsquo;s like to live in our own, modern world.</p>
<p>In the show, this season especially, you can see most of the main characters struggling to figure out who they are, and who they think they should be &ndash; or need to be &ndash; in a world that&rsquo;s changing in ways that they don&rsquo;t quite understand yet. (Some backstory for folks who haven&rsquo;t been watching: this season is set in 1962 and centers around a second tier Madison Avenue advertising firm &ndash; and some of the characters are just beginning to see glimmers that the future is going to be pretty different than what&rsquo;s come before.)</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of characters posing as something; trying out lives they think they should be living, but not always with great success. It&rsquo;s a sadder show this season, seems to me, but I think there&rsquo;s something incredibly modern about each of the characters as they try to make sense of the changes around them, as they try to read (and draw) maps of the world, as they try to figure out which way is home.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was pretty blown away by the last 2 episodes &ndash; great season so far.</p>

			 <p>The recent Mozilla Summit we held in Whistler was amazing to me for a lot of reasons, but maybe my favorite thing about the gathering was that we had so many of the localizers from around the world - dozens, I think. Each of them had an amazing, inspiring story, and every localized who I talked with left me excited about the future - not just of Mozilla, but of open software in general.</p>
<p>I got to spend a bit of time with Nagi, our Mongolian localized, in particular, and when he wasn&rsquo;t toying with me at ping ping, he told me a bit of his story. He grew up in Ulan Bator, capital of Mongolia, and moved to northern Germany in 2001 for school and work. He wanted an e-mail client in Mongolian, so he decided to localize the Mozilla Suite, and has been involved since. It&rsquo;s at once an amazing and characteristic Mozilla story - Nagi wanted to scratch an itch - so he started working on an open project, and as a result has made the Web more accessible to thousands of people. Inspirational.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s impossible to talk about Mozilla inspiration without mentioning the wonderful accessibility work done so diligently and for so long by Aaron Leventhal (long supported by Frank Hecker). Again, underappreciated work that has a gigantic impact on the lives of thousands.</p>
<p>Anyway, I left the Summit with more stories than before, and the knowledge that there are still a lot more to hear, and to tell, and still to be written.</p>

			 <p>After 3 years at Mozilla, our VP Engineering Mike Schroepfer, is moving on to other opportunities and we wish him well.</p>
<p>Here at Mozilla that means some changes are in order, and Mike Shaver is our new Interim VP Engineering. Mike&rsquo;s an amazing leader, deep technologist, committed Mozillian (Mozillite?, Mozillan?), and talented evangelist. He&rsquo;s contributed lots of code and innovation to our current code base, including a number of the key Javascript enhancements you&rsquo;re (hopefully) enjoying while reading this post in Firefox 3. He&rsquo;s one of the most articulate advocates of the Open Web, and one of the most inspiring speakers on that subject (and many others) that I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>All of which means that we&rsquo;re in great shape with Mike taking on this new responsibility. The rest of the management and leadership in the engineering team remains the same as previously.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a lot to do, starting with the upcoming Firefox 3.1 later this year, and I have great confidence that Mike will step into his new role and do a wonderful job.</p>

			 <p>As MIke <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mentioned over on his blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, after 3 years at Mozilla, he&rsquo;s moving on to new adventures. For anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know, he&rsquo;s been the VP Engineering for us during most of that period, and he has been a huge force for helping make great things happen. Among other things, he&rsquo;s been a great product execution person, a great technology strategist, a great source of ideas and inspiration, and a great recruiter.</p>
<p>But more than anything, he&rsquo;s been a great leader and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->teacher<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for everyone in the organization and in the larger community. And that means that while we&rsquo;ll miss his day-to-day contribution, he&rsquo;s left a legacy of other outstanding engineering managers and leaders ready to take new responsibilities &ndash; many of them who you can observe leading what we&rsquo;re doing already.</p>
<p>So Mozilla owes a big thanks to Mike for his contribution, and I think will miss him greatly.</p>
<p>As a personal note, Mike&rsquo;s been an extremely important collaborator and friend to me, and I&rsquo;ll miss our day-to-day interactions very much.</p>
<p>But life moves on, and if I were you, I&rsquo;d watch him closely, because he&rsquo;s going to do great things in his next post, too.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rebecca<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have each made postings (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Global Voices Summit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that happened a couple of weeks ago in Budapest, and it sounds like it was an incredible, wonderful event. I&rsquo;ve been tracking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Global Voices<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for just a little while, so not long enough to know the history, but long enough to know that it&rsquo;s a wondrous thing that shows so much of the global promise of the web. The idea is simple: it&rsquo;s a set of bloggers from all around the world, collected in one stream. The impact is profound: you get a sense of some of the real-time feelings &amp; thoughts &amp; perspectives that are happening around the world, not mediated through our traditional media or governmental channels.</p>
<p>The last couple of years I&rsquo;ve been lucky to do some traveling for Mozilla &ndash; in particular to China, Japan, and Europe &ndash; and have found my perspective on what the world looks like (and can/should look like) changing greatly. (And I&rsquo;m currently in the middle of Fareed Zakaria&rsquo;s excellent new book <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Post-American World<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on this subject.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just repeatedly blown away (and sometimes overwhelmed) by what Global Voices is doing &ndash; it seems to me a necessary point of view in a world where national boundaries seem more &amp; more artificial and sometimes obstructive to the way people are having conversations and getting things done.</p>

			 <p>I think everyone involved with Mozilla is humbled by the worldwide attention and coverage we&rsquo;ve gotten in the runup to and release of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; it&rsquo;s a little overwhelming, really.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about seeing a writeup in my hometown paper, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->San Jose Mercury News<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; the paper I&rsquo;ve grown up with here in Silicon Valley reading about most everything having to do with tech.</p>
<p>And they wrote today &ndash; the title of the article is &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Browser&rsquo;s open-source model represents valley at its best<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s an article that I couldn&rsquo;t be happier about. It gets the tone &amp; feeling of what we&rsquo;re doing just right.

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Markoff NYT piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from a few weeks back &ndash; it&rsquo;s on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intersection of technology innovation &amp; social mission<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The featured company in the article is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TechSoup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (formerly Compumentor), and Mozilla features in the article as well.</p>
<p>I was really happy to see Markoff write this piece &ndash; it&rsquo;s clear from here that there&rsquo;s a new type of organization emerging in the world that we term &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; &ndash; mission-driven companies like Mozilla and TechSoup, but who compete in the market with products and services. It seems to me that this is happening because the barriers to collaboration are falling precipitously &ndash; it&rsquo;s easier and cheaper than ever to get together with a group of like-minded folks to work on changing the world. So people seem to be doing it, which is wonderful.</p>
<p>TechSoup is hosting the 3rd annual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NetSquared Conference<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today (and blogging it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). The conference is outstanding, and was incredibly helpful to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PCF/Miro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> team last year, resulting in some long-lasting relationships.</p>
<p>NetSquared is a great gettogether of lots of organizations like this, and hopefully a preview of things to come, with more social mission organizations in the world. The TechSoup folks deserve a lot of praise for this sort of foresight and investment.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update 5/22/08:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> First, I do want to thank everyone for commenting &amp; discussing &ndash; this is a serious and important subject that people should care deeply about.</p>
<p>To make a few things clear:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<p>Had a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great conversation with Mike Arrington<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TechCrunch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday &ndash; resulted in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nice writeup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of one of the projects we&rsquo;ve been thinking about here at Mozilla over the last few months. He highlights the opportunity quite well, I think, and I&rsquo;d like to add some context here so everyone knows where we&rsquo;re coming from. One correction that I need to make up front: &ldquo;stealth project&rdquo; should read &ldquo;very early stage project that Mozilla has been open about,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s probably not quite as catchy a headline. :-)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Meeting Context<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For most of our hour we spent was talking about the upcoming release of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; which is on the way very soon now, and is a release that everyone involved is very proud of.</p>
<p>Towards the end of our time, Mike asked: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We answered similarly to our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->conversation with Matt Asay a while back<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in that we&rsquo;ve got about 4 things we&rsquo;re spending a fair bit of time thinking about: (1) the future of Firefox and the technology that powers it (the new version we&rsquo;re calling moz2), (2) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mobile Firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (code-named Fennec), (3) online services like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Weave<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and (4) data. Mike was particularly interested in the 4th item, data, and saw a lot of possibility in it.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Key Insight<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The key insight is not so much that rich clients or web sites are able to collect information about what people do, but rather that this data is one of the most important pieces to faciliate understanding (and innovation), and is also one of the most under-explored areas of the modern web.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again another way: while technology has gotten cheaper &amp; cheaper to deploy, and the connected nature of the global web means that you can start up a new worldwide service practically overnight for very little capital, there remain worlds of information about how people use the web that are locked up and not currently shared.</p>
<p>So we asked ourselves what we can do to help unlock some of this latent potential &ndash; and started thinking about whether there&rsquo;s a project we can do at Mozilla that does a few things:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Current Situation at Mozilla
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->First things first: we track very very little data today. I&rsquo;ve posted before that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we use our Application Update Service (AUS) pings to get a sense of where our main usage around the world is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to try to spot problems when they happen (it&rsquo;s notable that this is a secondary usage of that system &ndash; the primary function of AUS is to enable timely updates to the softeware we release &ndash; in Firefox 3 and future versions of Firefox 2, we&rsquo;ll watch instead an analogous ping that checks whether updates to add-ons are available.) Beyond that, we don&rsquo;t collect much data in the product at all.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a couple of projects started at a small level in this area &ndash; one is called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spectator<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an add-on mostly used to improve the user interface of Firefox, and another is a project in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Labs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Test Pilot<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They&rsquo;re both early and very limited in scope.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we&rsquo;re thinking about it and talking about it, but haven&rsquo;t staffed it very much &ndash; we don&rsquo;t even have a name for the project yet. What we do know is that data is important, and that there&rsquo;s a ton of potential for everyone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had most of the substance of these conversations in the open, like most everything we do, and we want to have more. Key to us doing anything is having even more conversations like this in public, and figuring out a set of core principles that go beyond just the level of opting-in.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad that Mike wrote about it &amp; sees some of the promise here. It&rsquo;s early days, but it seems to me at least that opening up all sorts of data &ndash; from web usage to the social graph &amp; beyond &ndash; is going to be the topic of conversation for a long time to come.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In a weird blast-from-the-past moment, TechCrunch reported yesterday that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hot mail startup Xobni has licensed the IP from Zaplet (nee Firedrop, and most recently bought by MetricStream)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a company we started from Reactivity nearly 10 years ago. TC has bits and pieces of the story, and gets most of the basics of the history right. Seems like both yesterday and an eternity ago when Mike Hanson and Brian Roddy and I were brainstorming about live HTML in e-mail and when Mike mocked up the first one &ndash; as we were searching for names, we started with Zimlet or Zaplet or Zammogram, among many other very bad names. Then Brian Axe took it and started to build a business case, recruited Dave Roberts, got some mad Firedrop namage &amp; logo help from Gentry, and was away to the races. (And IIRC, the Reactivity Austin team of Lynn and Dave and others built the screenshots showing up on TC now.)</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s neat to see that another piece of Reactivity technology is still breathing &ndash; and hopefully will be put to good use at Xobni.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this for a bit &ndash; I&rsquo;ve had my Kindle now for about 3 months (since Christmas) &ndash; and wanted to write down some of the things I think about it.</p>
<p>The most interesting observation, I think, is that it&rsquo;s simultaneously one of my favorite things, and also mostly invisible in my life. I use it every single day for at least 15-30 minutes and some days for considerably more. Since the new year, I&rsquo;ve read probably 8 books this way, compared with 3 or 4 traditional form books.</p>
<p>A few random observations:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The display works great &ndash; the resolution is not quite what I expected, but not bad at all, and is fine for reading even over a long period of time. I think they could have done a better job with the typography, with more tweakability in terms of fonts and layout preferences. I routinely change the type size when I&rsquo;m reading, depending on how tired I am, etc. Book layout gets screwed up pretty routinely, especially in books that have any images at all. Not totally debilitating, but distracting, certainly.</p>
<p>UI-wise, I think it&rsquo;s good enough, but not fantastic. The designers were pretty limited by the screen refresh characteristics of eInk &ndash; so had to do some decidedly indirect things for many of the interactions. But on the whole, it&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ve been highlighting passages in the books I read in order to go back and look at them when I&rsquo;m done &ndash; that&rsquo;s a really neat feature &ndash; but it&rsquo;s in an embryonic state at the moment. I&rsquo;d like to be able to access them via the web, not just my Kindle, and would like to have them be more like a database than a text file, which is what they are now. Being able to search in books is theoretically neat, and I&rsquo;ve used it a couple of times, but not really all that useful so far.</p>
<p>I really thought that I&rsquo;d miss the physicality of books, but I&rsquo;ve been surprised that I don&rsquo;t miss it one bit. I thought I&rsquo;d miss the feel of the pages, the images on the cover, etc &ndash; but I don&rsquo;t. On reflection, I&rsquo;ve realized that most of that stuff is marketing &ndash; not the intent of the author at all, in general &ndash; and as a result, I&rsquo;ve found myself paying much more attention to the text, and feeling closer to the authors.  Surprising to me. What I think I&rsquo;ve discovered is that while I thought I loved books, what I actually love is reading.</p>
<p>The weirdest side effect of doing most of my reading through the Kindle is that people don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m reading &ndash; that&rsquo;s great on airplanes and in public, but I like it less at home &ndash; my wife doesn&rsquo;t know what I read now, so doesn&rsquo;t ask as many questions about it. That&rsquo;s disappointing, since I like talking about the things I read. I still bring up things I&rsquo;m interested in, but I miss the other direction. Thinking a few years down the road, I&rsquo;m certain that our son will use some sort of eReader for text books for school &ndash; and as parents we&rsquo;re going to need to know what he&rsquo;s reading &ndash; that&rsquo;s an opportunity for someone, of course!</p>
<p>The related problem, for me, is that I tend to lose track, visually, of some of the more interesting books I read. I&rsquo;ve been getting tired of having shelves and shelves of books at home, but I pretty routinely find myself looking down one shelf or another, and noticing books that I read a while back that I want to re-read, or to think about again. WIth the Kindle, you can browse through what you&rsquo;ve read, but it&rsquo;s a little bloodless, so it&rsquo;s making things like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Delicious Library<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seem sort of appealing to me. But I&rsquo;m not 100% sure that&rsquo;s the right solution, either.</p>
<p>Sharing is another disappointing aspect - I&rsquo;ve read a few books the last couple of months that I&rsquo;d really like to just hand to my friends. There&rsquo;s no way to do that, and it&rsquo;s disappointing.</p>
<p>A million other thoughts about the system, ranging from big picture (I wish it were more open and less DRM-ed, for example) to small (the unit seems almost designed to show dirt on the casing; the dictionary &ndash; while fantastically useful &ndash; could be easier to use) to mostly irrelevant (not a good web browsing experience &ndash; IMHO they should have just left the browser out).</p>
<p>But on the whole, while I don&rsquo;t know that the Kindle will be the device that ultimately wins, I do know that the advantages of electronic, networked books are too significant not to become ubiquitious over time. It&rsquo;s early days, and this is really just the 2nd generation or so &ndash; but for a broad, broad set of uses, it&rsquo;s obviously the way things are going to go.</p>

<p>Anyway, lots and lots of interesting conversations going on about this the past few days &ndash; Mozilla is in an unusual position in that we are a mission-driven organization, but also have an actual product in the market that does compete with commercial organizations. Because of that competition, I think much of what we do &amp; say gets viewed through a revenue/marketshare lens, regardless of intent. It&rsquo;s easy to fall into that line of thinking &ndash; the world is geared towards it. And so it&rsquo;ll continue to be a challenge for us, as Mozilla, to point out practices that are troubling in products that are competitive.</p>
<p>I think that no matter what we say, we&rsquo;ll get articles and blog posts written about our motivations and whether they&rsquo;re related to revenue.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll continue to make decisions and build products based on user experience first and let folks make their own minds up regarding our motives. That&rsquo;s the way Mozilla has always been, seems to me.</p>

			 <p>Lest anyone be at all confused about my motives in writing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my recent post about Apple Software Update<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I&rsquo;ll say this unequivocally: it isn&rsquo;t about competition. [I wrote what I meant in my post &ndash; there&rsquo;s no subtext at all &ndash; it&rsquo;s all on the page, so I won&rsquo;t rehash it here.]</p>
<p>To the contrary: competition is good &ndash; necessary, actually. Competition &ndash; or, more the point, the ability of people to choose what tools and services they use &ndash; is essential, and without it nothing gets better.</p>
<p>As a consumer, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more competition. I want things like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mint.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to put pressure on Intuit, for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FriendFeed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to put pressure on Facebook, for Netflix to put pressure on Blockbuster. And for other browsers (like Safari) to put pressure on IE, and, yes, Firefox. And I want competition in my role at Mozilla, too &ndash; competition makes everyone work harder to listen to what people are saying about what they want, and to work harder to deliver something that is great.</p>
<p>Firefox is better because there&rsquo;s competition from Safari and others &ndash; that&rsquo;s great, because it means that normal people can find the software that works best for them and make their own choices. Firefox 3 is an incredibly great browser, I think, and competition has helped that, resulting in things like our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->amazing memory footprint<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->incredibly useful AwesomeBar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and literally thousands of other improvements.</p>
<p>Competition &ndash; and choice &ndash; is central to everything we do; without it, we&rsquo;re nowhere.</p>

			 <p>What Apple is doing now with their Apple Software Update on Windows is wrong. It undermines the trust relationship great companies have with their customers, and that&rsquo;s bad &ndash; not just for Apple, but for the security of the whole Web. What they did yesterday was to use their updater for iTunes to also install their Safari Web browser &ndash;what follows is some background and analysis.</p>
<p>Keeping software up to date is hard &ndash; hard for consumers to understand what patches are for, how to make sure they&rsquo;re up to date.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also critically, crucially important for the security of end users and for the security of the Web at large that people stay current. If people don&rsquo;t update software regularly, it is impossible for them to remain safe; good software developers are creating improvements constantly. That&rsquo;s why Mozilla spends so much time making sure our own Automatic Update Service works, and why we spend so much time agonizing over the user interface for the updates. We look at the data every time we do an update; we obsess about what we call &ldquo;uptake rates&rdquo; &ndash; the percentage of Firefox users who are on the most current version of the browser a day or a week or a month after release. As a result, Firefox users are incredibly up to date, and adopt very quickly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an implicit trust relationship between software makers and customers in this regard: as a software maker we promise to do our very best to keep users safe and will provide the quickest updates possible, with absolutely no other agenda. And when the user trusts the software maker, they&rsquo;ll generally go ahead and install the patch, keeping themselves and everyone else safe.</p>
<p>Anyone who uses iTunes on Windows has Apple Software Update installed on their machines, which does just what I&rsquo;ve described above: it checks for new patches available for Apple-produced software on your Windows machine, alerts the user to the availability, and allows updates to be installed. That&rsquo;s great &ndash; wonderful, in fact. Makes everyone more likely to have current, patched versions of Apple&rsquo;s software, and makes everyone safer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s screen that comes up on Windows XP if you&rsquo;ve got iTunes installed:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The problem here is that it lists Safari for getting an update &ndash; and has the &ldquo;Install&rdquo; box checked by default &ndash; even if you haven&rsquo;t ever installed Safari on your PC.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a problem because of the dynamic I described above &ndash; by and large, all software makers are trying to get users to trust us on updates, and so the likely behavior here is for users to just click &ldquo;Install 2 items,&rdquo; which means that they&rsquo;ve now installed a completely new piece of software, quite possibly completely unintentionally. Apple has made it incredibly easy &ndash; the default, even &ndash; for users to install ride along software that they didn&rsquo;t ask for, and maybe didn&rsquo;t want. This is wrong, and borders on malware distribution practices.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrong because it undermines the trust that we&rsquo;re all trying to build with users. Because it means that an update isn&rsquo;t just an update, but is maybe something more. Because it ultimately undermines the safety of users on the web by eroding that relationship. It&rsquo;s a bad practice and should stop.</p>
<p>[I&rsquo;ll make 2 points that I want to make very clear: (1) this is not a criticism of Safari as a web browser in any way, and (2) I have no objections to the basic industry practice of using your installed software as a channel for other software. This is specifically a criticism of the way they&rsquo;re using the updating system. I&rsquo;d much prefer to be writing about Firefox, but this practice hurts everyone and is important to note.]</p>

I believe deeply in the strengths of the US system &ndash; in the incredible way that the 2 fundamentally different constructions of the Declaration and the Constitution work together to make a fabric that has stood up to time. Again and again through US history, there have been serious challenges to the nation, and executives who have done exceptionally damaging things &ndash; in the tumult after Washington left, in the Civil War and its aftermath, during the Great Depression, during Vietnam.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty despondent in this last cycle that the executive branch of our government has finally done some things that were so extra-constitutional and so damaging, that we&rsquo;d not be able to re-weave the fabric of the US like we&rsquo;ve done again and again for more than 200 years now. But this speech by Obama gives me hope. Not necessarily because he&rsquo;ll become our next president, but because he shows that leadership can inspire without dumbing things down; that leadership can make you want to be better without speaking to your own base motivations and desires.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is real, undiluted, inspirational leadership, and it gives me hope.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking that same thing about CNN &ndash; WTF? Here&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->site with some of the more absurd headlines from CNN<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lately, but even without the news about how Bono&rsquo;s neighbors' smoke is bothering him or tips on how you can live in a spaceship (both, sadly, actual headlines), I&rsquo;ve felt that CNN on the Web has gotten painfully bad (not to mention gems on television like Anderson Cooper 360, because, as everyone knows, he is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Mole<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.) The most egregious problem I&rsquo;ve noticed lately is the ridiculous inclusion of articles written by advertising partners like CareerBuilder.com &ndash; while there are notes that they&rsquo;re written by business partners, they&rsquo;re packaged and formatted like any other articles on the site &ndash; painful, painful bias.)</p>
<p>I keep checking CNN for my news mostly from habit and muscle memory, but need to find something better. I think what I&rsquo;m looking for has these characteristics:</p>

			 <p>Well, that&rsquo;s it for The Wire &ndash; best show on television. Last night&rsquo;s finale was great, I thought &ndash; gave a bunch of closure, a bunch of provocative ideas, and, more than anything else, a sense that it&rsquo;s a new day, but the same old stuff is going to happen.  It&rsquo;s been hard to watch the series without despairing about the prevalence of corruption &ndash; so many of our institutions are so broken. This last season was probably the weakest of the 5 seasons &ndash; but I&rsquo;ll take bad episodes of The Wire over just about anything else on TV. So many memorable characters, so much wonderful dialog, and so many clear and compelling messages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impatient to see what David Simon and Ed Burns come with next, not to mention actor/director <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clark Johnson<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who always seems to be involved with my favorite shows &ndash; especially his direction, and the unbelievable cast of other writers who include Dennis Lehand and George Pelecanos. But I&rsquo;m not optimistic that they&rsquo;ll be able to do something like this again &ndash; not in a Sorkin/Studio 60 sorta way &ndash; but in the sense that The Wire seems to be a singular achievement. No doubt.</p>

I have no doubt that they&rsquo;ll all land happily and do great with their next thing &ndash; but I also have no doubt that it&rsquo;s a trying time for them.

			 <p>Traveling for Mozilla is a humbling experience. It&rsquo;s easy sometimes to look at the rise of Firefox as a market phenomenon, as a set of amazing numbers, as a set of graphs all trending up and to the right. And that&rsquo;s true enough, of course &ndash; but the eye-popping numbers &ndash; the maybe 150,000,000 (we hit 50M daily users a couple of weeks ago, which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->roughly equates to 150M active<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) people around the world who use the technology &ndash; they&rsquo;re gaudy enough that sometimes they obscure the more important story.</p>
<p>The story&rsquo;s simple &ndash; it started <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 years ago<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a way that not many people knew how to interpret at the time or since &ndash; but it&rsquo;s always been a story of individuals deciding that the world can, and should, be better, and that the best way to make that happen is to jump in and get started.</p>
<p>That the best way to get a menu to look a certain way is to start writing code. That the best way to get a browser in a certain language is start translating strings. That the best way to help people understand the importance of the Internet is to start talking to everyone.</p>
<p>This trip, and every trip I&rsquo;ve taken for Mozilla &ndash; 3 to Europe, 5 to Japan, and 3 to China so far &ndash; has been an object lesson in this theme. I got to spend time with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tristan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Peter, who decided some years ago that Mozilla in Europe was important enough to start with uncertain prospects &ndash; they&rsquo;re amazing in their dedication and results. And with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pascal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who is so generative and productive that the running joke is that he&rsquo;s going to have to get some sleep one of these years. And Anne-Julie and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jane<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who&rsquo;re bringing marketing skills to bear on the problem. This trip I also got to spend time with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zbigniew Braniecki<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (aka Gandalf), who&rsquo;s a member (among many, many others, as he&rsquo;ll attest) in our Polish community and is inspiring to talk with about any subject.</p>
<p>Anyway, last week reminded me yet again of how many people there are around the world who care incredibly deeply about keeping the web open &ndash; not just in Europe or Mountain View, but everywhere. Thanks to everyone for a great week.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes in life, you find an opportunity to make a difference in something you care about, and it feels like, even though you didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, that the last few years have really just been practice, giving you the background, skills and ability to really help. And in a very few circumstances &ndash; once or twice in a lifetime if you&rsquo;re lucky &ndash; the opportunity you get to make a difference is one that has a very large, even global impact. My new role as CEO of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Corporation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> feels like one of those times. [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s Mitchell&rsquo;s announcement.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->]</p>
<p>For me, joining Mozilla in 2005 was one of those special opportunities. I&rsquo;d been working on my own startup, Reactivity, for the previous 7 years, learning how to build and operate an entrepreneurial venture that was focused on creativity and innovation. I was thinking about what I wanted to do next. I had gotten interested in the dynamics of open source projects through knowing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mitch Kapor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (previously an investor in Reactivity) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mitchell Baker<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the incredible, shocking, amazing story of Firefox during the previous year just blew me away. So I wondered out loud to Mitchell whether or not I could help, and whether Mozilla needed any help.</p>
<p>At which point she laughed of course, because after this small group of open source, non-corporate, non-profiteers had officially launched Firefox 1.0 a few months earlier, they found themselves in a situation where they had gone from a few hundred thousand users to over 10 million. They were going through a period of intense growth and pressure, not to mention increasing expectations from the whole world. Expectations that they&rsquo;d continue to improve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thunderbird<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that they&rsquo;d foster an increasingly robust community of contributors, and that they&rsquo;d continue to look out for the health of the Web.</p>
<p>So I joined up, started to help. While I care a lot about products and user experiences (and that&rsquo;s where my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->academic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and early <!-- raw HTML omitted -->career background <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is), that stuff was in excellent condition because of the amazing team of contributors and developers and designers and testers &ndash; so I focused on a couple of bits that needed more help: (1) helping other organizations understand and work better with Mozilla, and (2) getting the Mozilla organization itself to be ready to meet increased expectations from the world, which would demand people growth. Since that summer, we&rsquo;ve grown a lot. We released Firefox 1.5 and 2, as well as Thunderbird 2, grew the number of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->community extensions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to more than 4,000, increased our employee base to something close to 150 worldwide (including beefing up our teams in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Japan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Europe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and starting one in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->China<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), and we&rsquo;ve got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more than 125 million users<!-- raw HTML omitted --> around the world now.</p>
<p>Along the way, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about Mozilla, open source, and the Web itself. I believe that the Web is the single most important innovation of our lifetimes, for reasons both mundane and profound. It affects everything. Today&rsquo;s Web is healthy due to the efforts of millions of people, for sure &ndash; people and companies and governments, volunteers and employees and contributors &ndash; and every time I interact with people in the Mozilla community, I&rsquo;m blown away by the level of dedication to keeping the Web healthy, and, just as important, participatory, for as many people around the globe as possible.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that I&rsquo;m excited by the challenge of my new job. I&rsquo;ve thought an awful lot about the role of MoCo (our shorthand for the Corporation) in supporting the Mozilla mission and manifesto, as the coordination point for our work on the platform and on Firefox. We&rsquo;ve got a lot to do in the coming years, starting with getting Firefox 3 out the door, and then swiftly followed up by our work in mobile and services. Mozilla2 will be a major step forward on the platform after that, not to mention our new experiments in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Labs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the work that we&rsquo;re doing to move the whole Web forward with Javascript 2, HTML 5 and other standards work.</p>
<p>Even so, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that the most successful case for MoCo will be when the corporation itself is sort of invisible. That is, when MoCo can support <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla&rsquo;s mission<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, providing economic sustainability, project coordination, and a connection to real users around the world, while getting out of the way of what our community all around the world is doing. Understand that I&rsquo;m not saying that Mozilla should be invisible &ndash; to the contrary, a strong, vibrant and visible Mozilla is having a major positive impact on the evolution of the Web today, and should continue to. What I&rsquo;m saying is that in a success case, the mechanics of the Corporation &ndash; some of the specifics about the way we organize to get things done &ndash; will not be as apparent (or as in the way as they can sometimes be) as the project.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a deceptively simple goal, certainly. With thousands of contributors, more than 125 million users, and countless organizations that depend on the extended community and our technology, we&rsquo;re in uncharted territory. There aren&rsquo;t any good models for what we&rsquo;re doing right now, for hybrid organizations who&rsquo;re using market-based economics to drive mission-oriented goals, or for open source projects that so many end users depend on. So just like experiments in the code or the user interface, we&rsquo;ll be doing more experiments in how the MoCo organization can best use our products and our people to support the mission. Experiments like Mozilla China, where we&rsquo;ve quadrupled our user base this year, and like Mozilla Labs, where we&rsquo;re trying to create a new form of laboratory in which we&rsquo;ve never even met most of the experimenters.</p>
<p>A number of these experiments and initiatives Mitchell&rsquo;s already involved in, and there are a number of new initiatives that she can start now. Mitchell has made enormous contributions so far &ndash; from the original Mozilla Public License to being at the helm through the years at AOL, to starting the Foundation, and lately to charting new territory and scale with end-user open source software. Lately she&rsquo;s been thinking more about core issues of participation and openness for end users, how to make hybrid organizations work, and how to unstick the often frustrating standards process. I expect her to pull Mozilla into new areas and to continue to be the chief advocate for the participatory Web. From a very personal standpoint, I&rsquo;ve learned an awful lot from Mitchell over the past couple of years, and am looking forward to being challenged by and working with her more going forward.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to do, by a lot of people. For myself, I&rsquo;ve got a few major priorities for the coming months:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do whatever I can to help get Firefox 3 out the door &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta 2 just released<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and folks who have used it feel like it&rsquo;s an exceptionally good product that an awful lot of people will like (and do already).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Ascher<!-- raw HTML omitted --> get the new Mozilla mail company off the ground, and get Thunderbird on a safe footing for the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve Mozilla&rsquo;s understandability and knowability across the board. While we&rsquo;ve grown over the past couple of years, it&rsquo;s been hard to make sure that we&rsquo;re always communicating as well as we&rsquo;re able to, and as well as our community and users need us to. We try hard on this, and we&rsquo;re improving, but we can and will do more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase our communications about how we&rsquo;re thinking about economic sustainability &ndash; we&rsquo;ve got some things figured out and some we haven&rsquo;t &ndash; but I&rsquo;d like us to start talking more in public about how the future looks for Mozilla, and I&rsquo;d especially like to share our thinking with, and benefit from others' thinking on how to make hybrid organizations work. (Organizations that come to mind include the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Participatory Culture Foundation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kiva.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support Mitchell&rsquo;s new projects to broaden Mozilla&rsquo;s impact &ndash; she&rsquo;s been thinking about a number of new initiatives over the past few months that could have a great effect on the world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s a start, anyway. As is the norm for Mozilla, the number and variety of projects that we can be involved in and make a difference for is astounding &ndash; and I&rsquo;m optimistic that we&rsquo;ll be able to continue to improve the participatory Web in 2008 and beyond.</p>
<p>I feel both very excited and very fortunate to find myself in this spot, and am looking forward to doing what I can to help Mozilla continue to make the Web a better place.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Henry Blodget did a followup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just now, with some further thoughts.</p>
<p>There are some details we should clear up in a further post (some of the mechanics are a little mis-stated in Blodget&rsquo;s postings), but I want to focus on the intent. First, there&rsquo;s no presumption that for-profit (or, more properly, non-tax-exempt) entities are bad and non-profits are good. As Henry suggests, that&rsquo;s a ridiculous, naive position to take. I&rsquo;ve been parts of many for profit companies and think that there are many who do incredibly important things for their shareholders and the world. Absolutely. But the reason that we&rsquo;re non-tax-exempt in the Mozilla Corporation is so that we can properly pay taxes, not to maximize profits.</p>
<p>My argument (and Mitchell&rsquo;s) is much simpler and more elemental: we&rsquo;ve said before many times that Mozilla&rsquo;s mission &ndash; keeping the Internet open and participatory &ndash; is the most important thing for us to pursue, full stop. Mitchell&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogged at length on the Mozilla Manifesto<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; and that Manifesto is the covenant that the Mozilla project &ndash; encompassing the Foundation, the Corporation, and more &ndash; has made with the community. Like any organization, we&rsquo;re imperfect, but in intent and in daily practice, we measure ourselves against the Manifesto, and we believe, for all the reasons that we&rsquo;ve articulated, pursuit of these goals is best achieved as an independent company, with no shareholders who would conceivably want to focus on short-term (or even long-term) profits instead of the public benefit mission.</p>
<p>In any event, this is an interesting discussion (if unexpected on the third day of the new year) to be having &ndash; and I hope that it starts a broader conversation about what ways we can best achieve the goals in the Manifesto.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s been a bit of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->speculation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today about Mozilla on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Silicon Alley Insider<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NYT blog)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I&rsquo;d like to set the record straight.</p>
<p>Irrespective of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->financials<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Blodget is wrong about the desire and intent of Mozilla to do any public offering of stock. Mitchell&rsquo;s written about this many times at great length: the work we do in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla project is a public asset<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->followup article, too<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). It&rsquo;s the wrong thing to do ethically, but aside from that, selling shares of Mozilla would make it hard (or maybe impossible) to pursue our mission and goals.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We&rsquo;ve said this before on the record and we&rsquo;ll reiterate categorically that there&rsquo;s no intent or desire to do a public offering, no plans to do so, and an overwhelming sentiment here that to do something like this would fundamentally undermine what Mozilla is about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Gen&rsquo;s already <!-- raw HTML omitted -->picked this up on his blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it&rsquo;s worth writing about again &ndash; the Mozilla community in Korea had a dinner together &ndash; 50 people who care about Mozilla and Firefox and open source got together to break bread and talk. One of the fun exercises they did was to have these signs that say &ldquo;For me, Firefox is &lt;blank&gt;&rdquo; &ndash; then everyone filled in the blanks. The answers are amazing, of course &ndash; they include things like &ldquo;vision&rdquo; and &ldquo;oxygen&rdquo; and &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; and even &ldquo;means of livelihood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a really good time looking at the pictures that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Channy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> posted &ndash; such a great glimpse into their community. He&rsquo;s been tireless in promoting Mozilla and open source in Korea &ndash; a tough environment for these things. That this community exists at all in Korea is amazing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s helped me to articulate some of the things that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about lately with respect to Mozilla around the world. Over the past couple of years I&rsquo;ve spent a good bit of time working with Takita-san, Kaori and Gen (and many others) on Mozilla Japan, with Tristan and Peter and Pascal and Anne-Julie and Axel (and many others) on Mozilla Europe, and (lately), with Li and the Mozilla Online team on our efforts in China. Every single time I interact with any of these folks that I&rsquo;ve mentioned (and many more who I haven&rsquo;t, including contributors in places like Brazil, Russia, Taiwan, New Zealand and Poland), I learn new things. I learn about new perspectives, about cultural and geographical and political influences on thinking, and more about the way the world works. It&rsquo;s one of my very favorite things about working at Mozilla.</p>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve noticed a problem with some of the language that I use &ndash; when we talk about Mozilla Japan, or Mozilla Europe, or Mozilla China, I think that there&rsquo;s a tendency to think of these groups as similar, or at least to emphasize the sameness across each.</p>
<p>Not only is that a completely misleading view, it can cause serious errors in thought about how we do work with each other. Because here&rsquo;s the key: while they share a similarity of name (Mozilla X), in almost all other respects, they&rsquo;re wholly unique.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to think of each of these organizations as essentially unique, authentic manifestations of Mozilla that are grounded both in the culture of Mozilla and the culture of the geographies that they&rsquo;ve developed in.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Japan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> spends a lot of time focusing on institutions &ndash; government, enterprises, device manufacturers, etc &ndash; because so much of the work around the Internet, and especially the PC-based Internet (as opposed to mobile) is centered around these institutions.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla China<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (known as Mozilla Online) is a little more commercial and consumer-oriented than Mozilla Japan &ndash; at present, they&rsquo;re working on figuring out how the browser situation in China looks, and how to help more folks learn about Firefox. (To date, there&rsquo;s less clear demand in China for a rich e-mail client like Thunderbird.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Europe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is something different yet again &ndash; it has so many characteristics of a people&rsquo;s movement &ndash; an uprising against the old order. In Europe, more than maybe anywhere else in the world, the Mozilla values seem to be as important or more important than the qualities of the actual Firefox and Thunderbird products. More than anywhere else in the world, when I talk with Europeans, they use Firefox because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, not just because they like how it works (although they also like how it works). Europe is more than a single place, of course &ndash; our communities in France and Germany and Poland are incredibly strong, each for their own idiosyncratic reasons.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been trying hard to break my mental model that previously had these three entities as similar, and have been thinking more and more about them as unique expressions. That means it&rsquo;s more complicated to operate, to budget, to plan, and to coordinate, but it better reflects the way things are.</p>
<p>One other similarity bears emphasizing: these organizations each exist because of amazing, unbelievable efforts of amazing, unbelievable people who I admire quite a lot. I feel lucky to work with Tristan and Peter who willed Mozilla Europe into being, with Takita-san who&rsquo;s made Mozilla Japan possible, and lately with Li, who first helped us establish the Mozilla Foundation in China  two years ago and is building something new there now.</p>

			 <p>I was curious to see how having a Kindle might make a real difference in my life, so spent an hour this weekend looking at my 2007 Amazon purchase history, checking out which titles were available on the Kindle and which weren&rsquo;t, pricing differences, etc. Doesn&rsquo;t count the books I bought in airports or, you know, in real life instead of on the web.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s what I found: of the 58 books I bought from Amazon, 39 (67%) are available in Kindle while 19 (33%) aren&rsquo;t. For fiction, it&rsquo;s 16/23 (70%), and for non-fiction it&rsquo;s 23/35 (65%).</p>
<p>Overall, I spent $837.34 on books from Amazon in 2007 &ndash; of the books that were available on Kindle, I spent $578.14, compared to Kindle-pricing of $380.01, for a savings of $198.13. (When you include the price of the hardware at $400, means it&rsquo;ll take 2 years to pay for itself.)</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the kicker: of the 23,034 pages of books I purchased last year, 14,871 (64%) could have come to me as electrons instead of dead trees. Now, I&rsquo;m not being naive &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have the tools to do some sort of eco-analysis on the total energy footprint of the Kindle and servers compared to the relatively-more-efficient-and-developed printing industry. But I do know that there are several 500+ page books that I&rsquo;m just not reading because they&rsquo;re too big to drag around. Halberstam&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Coldest Winter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for example, or Winik&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Great Upheaval<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or Follett&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->World Without End<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And I think with a Kindle, I would start reading them all.</p>
<p>[disclaimer: there&rsquo;s some pricing and page count funkiness because of the timing of the analysis, availability of paperbacks now versus hardbacks then, etc. also, i should note that the real-paper catalog on amazon doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the same as the kindle catalog &ndash; they&rsquo;ve got lots of sync work to do there. titles were different, searching was different, etc.]</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll note also that of the 58, I&rsquo;ve loaned out probably a dozen this year to friends &ndash; something that&rsquo;s impossible at the moment with the Kindle.</p>
<p>Anyway was an interesting exercise for me &ndash; I think that for someone who reads as much or more as I do, this&rsquo;ll make a ton of sense. For others, I think waiting will make more sense.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an image of the spreadsheet if you&rsquo;re interested&hellip;fiction at the top, non-fiction at the bottom; available titles in green, unavailable in red.</p>

			 <p>Noam Cohen has an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article in today&rsquo;s New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about a new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> initiative to pay $40 per illustration for some number of needed images for the online encyclopedia. (I haven&rsquo;t checked into the story enough to confirm with the Wikipedia principals though. In the meantime, they&rsquo;ve got an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about what they&rsquo;re up to, fundraising-wise in particular.)</p>
<p>This marks the first time that Wikipedia is paying people for their contributions (although I believe they have a small paid staff working on things full-time).</p>
<p>I, for one, am really happy that they&rsquo;re experimenting here. I don&rsquo;t know (and don&rsquo;t think that anyone does) what will happen, how the broader community of contributors and content consumers will feel about the change, and whether it&rsquo;ll be significant for them or not.</p>
<p>But I am ecstatic that they&rsquo;re experimenting with ways to make an already great Wikipedia even better, even when they knew there would be articles with negative overtones that would start to appear.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hopeful that there will be more of these hybrid experiments, and in particular more of them attempted at the global scale of a project like Wikipedia or Mozilla. We&rsquo;re in the middle of a bunch of them here, including staffing up around the world, working with commercial partners for distribution, and generating revenue from partnerships. Not your traditional non-profit endeavor, but I think yielding results that are quite positive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a growing number of these hybrid companies operating on the Web today &ndash; we&rsquo;re trying to smudge some of the distinctions between non-profit and for-profit, between project and company. They&rsquo;re organizations/companies like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Creative Commons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Participatory Culture Foundation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kiva.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I know there are more out there, and I&rsquo;m incredibly excited that it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>One other point: while it can be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->uncomfortable to show up in the Times<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I&rsquo;m very glad that Noam and others are starting to write about efforts like Wikipedia&rsquo;s and Mozilla&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;re not easy to categorize, really &ndash; and we&rsquo;re just starting to learn how to talk about, let alone measure, the techniques, strategies and  efficacy of public benefit mission-oriented organizations who&rsquo;re using Internet market mechanisms (both for revenue and for the spend side).</p>

		<a href="https://johnolilly.com/2007/11/27/mozilla-amp-firefox-market-share.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-11-28 03:00:55 &#43;0700">Nov 28, 2007</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is a super-long post, so I&rsquo;ll start with the punchlines:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<p>One of the most interesting things about Mozilla is figuring out how we&rsquo;re doing, and where to focus and spend time. We look at many indicators; some of the most important are things like the health of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->addons.mozilla.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the volume and quality of community contributions to our platform and products, and the vitality of Mozilla-related discussions in the blogosphere. 2 other more numerical indicators that we track are Firefox market share (sliced a number of different ways) and the raw number of users of Firefox.</p>
<p>Lots of people report market share for Firefox &ndash; it&rsquo;s a succinct indicator of momentum in the market and with users, and makes a great headline to report that we&rsquo;re eating IE&rsquo;s share worldwide, or have exceeded 30% in Germany, or have tripled our share in China this year. And by any account, our market share everywhere is growing &ndash; extremely quickly in places like Spain and China and Brazil, somewhat more moderately in the US and Japan &ndash; but growing in every locale around the world.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go back a step: Mozilla (in all forms, including the Foundation, the Corporation, etc) is a public benefit endeavor, with the primary mission of keeping the Internet open and participatory. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So why would we care about market share,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> something that&rsquo;s traditionally associated with shall-we-say less mission-oriented motivations? In my view there are at least 3 basic reasons that we care (and probably many more):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We also look to data from individual sites to help us understand Firefox usage. Historically we&rsquo;ve skewed very high on techie sites and early adopter sites &ndash; for many Silicon Valley startups Firefox use represents well over half their traffic for a significant part of their early life. Conversely, we&rsquo;ll tend to see lower-than-average Firefox usage on some of the more mass market populations. It&rsquo;s been hard for us to share this type of data broadly because of the idiosyncratic nature of what we see, and because most of this type of data is shared with us with the understanding that we&rsquo;ll not republish. But on the whole, the data that we&rsquo;re seeing shows Firefox at something like 19-20% worldwide on sites that we consider mainstream.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another, subtler issue here: most of these measures are in page views, not users. (This makes sense, as by and large, the thing that folks are trying to track is market share of web properties, not the applications that you use to get to them.) As hard as it is to get an accurate read on worldwide traffic numbers for Firefox, it&rsquo;s even harder to figure out the relationship between page views and users. We have some intuitions here, supported by anecdotal evidence, that Firefox users look at more pages and do more searches than typical users, but nothing that I&rsquo;d actually call science.</p>
<p>So in addition to these indicators, we also use our own systems to get a sense of the number of actual Firefox users there are in the world (using each language version).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At present, we believe there are at least 125,000,000 Firefox users in the world, give or take.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how we get to that number. Firefox uses a system that we call AUS (Application Update Service) to keep itself up-to-date with security patches &amp; such. Around once a day, Firefox will ping Mozilla servers to see if there&rsquo;s a new update available, and if there is, it&rsquo;ll present an option to users to download and install it. (AUS really deserves a longer posting &ndash; the ping is non-identifiable, respecting user privacy, and is one of the major reasons that the Firefox user base, as large as it is, is nearly all using the most recent, patched version at any given time.)</p>
<p>We count those pings, categorized by language version of Firefox, so we have a rough indication for any given day about how many instances of Firefox were running. (It&rsquo;s decidedly rough &ndash; part of that is algorithmic, part of it is due to Firefox running in enterprises behind firewalls or other complex topologies, and part of it is usage based, depending on how people start and stop the application.) It&rsquo;s rough, but it&rsquo;s close, and we&rsquo;ve kept track of the numbers over the past couple of years, since we released Firefox 1.5 (the first Firefox that included AUS). We call these Active Daily Users, and it&rsquo;s a measure of the successful pings in a given day. Here&rsquo;s a chart of Active Daily Users over the last year, since we released Firefox 2 at the end of October 2006:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>What that says is that averaged over a 7 day period, we&rsquo;ve gone from 23M Active Daily Users in October 2006 to 42M a couple of weeks ago. (And we actually hit 48.8M yesterday, an all-time high that shows continued strong growth over the last few months.)</p>
<p>To get from the ADU number to our whole worldwide number of users, measured in terms of uniques in a given month, like most every web site does, we multiply ADU by 3. So for a couple of weeks ago, with 42M ADUs, we compute that we have something in excess of 126M unique monthly users.</p>
<p>This is a conservative multiplier (we think it could be more like 3.5) that we&rsquo;ve gotten to by doing some of our own experiments, piecing together data we&rsquo;ve received from sites who have done their own calculations, and then really testing them against the best common sense top-down tests we can. Here&rsquo;s one: take our estimate of monthly users (126M) and divide by the whole number of Internet users in the world (Internet World Stats puts the current at 1.2B)  &ndash; you end up with about 10.5%, which is lower than most reports of our global traffic share. You can do a bunch of mental gymnastics from there to account for higher-page-views-than-average for typical Firefox users, an overcounting of usage worldwide, etc &ndash; but for our purposes here at Mozilla, we use a multiplier of 3 to approximate the number of worldwide Firefox users.</p>
<p>But, really, the absolute number of users around the world is less important than the trending. Are more people finding their way to Firefox? (yes!) How about in Brazil? (yes again) What happens over holidays? (people don&rsquo;t use their computers as much &ndash; yay!) What happens when we do security updates? (usage goes down as anti-virus software updates get propagated, but recovers over the following week or 2)</p>
<hr>
<p>Phew. That was a longer post than I thought it would be. More to come on topics like the annual autumn surge in usage, huge growth in China and Spain this year, and others.</p>

			 <p>As anyone around me can attest, I&rsquo;ve been a little bit obsessed with Amazon&rsquo;s Kindle lately. I&rsquo;m interested in most everything about it &ndash; the form factor, the publishing industry, the readability, the tactile loss of books, the comparisons to the iPod economy &ndash; on and on. I&rsquo;ve also been thinking a lot about Sunnyvale&rsquo;s 50 year old library and our electorate&rsquo;s reluctance to build a new one. And on a personal level I&rsquo;ve been noting that while when I used to travel I&rsquo;d read several books each trip, increasingly I&rsquo;m watching videos and listening to music instead. And then I read a book called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Terror Presidency<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Jack Goldsmith, former top lawyer at OLC and the guy who overturned the infamous &ldquo;torture memo&rdquo; &ndash; and was reminded how seldom we see long-form arguments anymore &ndash; that we most often get our news and public discourse in headlines, Daily Show gags, and the front page of the Times while waiting in line at Starbucks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been worried about reading of late &ndash; both my own (although I&rsquo;m still doing fine, and have about a half dozen books to blog soon), and our society&rsquo;s. The National Endowment for the Arts just published a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->collection of studies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which indicates some bad news on this front. A few bits:</p>

<p>Disquieting for me, at best.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m reading more and more reviews of the new Amazon Kindle that I think are missing the point. A few more thoughts here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very heavy reader &ndash; I&rsquo;ll buy/read/skim between 100 and 200 books a year, give or take.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a lot of books in my house &ndash; thousands, easily. And they&rsquo;re heavy, take up a lot of space, and are made from a lot of trees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the physical nature of books and magazines for a few different reasons. I use books that I&rsquo;ve purchased but haven&rsquo;t read like a &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list of what to read next. Sometimes books take me a year or two to get around to reading, but their presence on my &ldquo;unread&rdquo; bookshelf reminds me that I&rsquo;m interested in it. I also sometimes like looking at my favorite books on my bookshelf, sometimes rereading them. I like the physicality &amp; visual nature of magazines better than I like the physicality of individual books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t always re-read books &ndash; and, in fact, nearly never do &ndash; I love loaning them out. I don&rsquo;t generally care whether I get them back, except in a few special cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I travel anywhere, I always take at least 2 books with me &ndash; one fiction and one non-fiction &ndash; and often take 1 or 2 more, depending on my mood. They&rsquo;re heavy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Amazon isn&rsquo;t my favorite store (they used to be, but now I find them more like Wal-mart in attitude than I&rsquo;d like), I do end up buying most of my books from there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That stuff is all background &ndash; here are my thoughts now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get a Kindle. I&rsquo;ve been dying for an easy-to-use ebook with titles that I read. I need to check more closely, but think that something like 80% of the books on my &ldquo;to read&rdquo; shelf are available. That&rsquo;s a new development. In particular, the 3 ~1,000 page books on my shelf (the new Halberstam on Korea, the new Winik on the 1780s, and the new Follet on the Middle Ages) are available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re taking the exact playbook from Apple/iPod/iTunes Store, and it&rsquo;s crappy, on the whole. For one thing, there&rsquo;s no mass of unprotected ebooks like there was unprotected mp3s &ndash; so you&rsquo;re locked into Amazon&rsquo;s store much more than the iTunes store, even. Really sucks. Crappy that you can&rsquo;t share at all, loan them to others, print them. And unlike music, there&rsquo;s no good way to rip the books that you have, putting them into your library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pricing is an absolute breakthrough, and could do to the publishing industry what iTunes pricing has done to music and (hopefully) videos. That&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To folks who have said that iPhones/iPods/music players are just as good: not a chance. Luminous LCD screens are not like eInk, which has the optical properties of paper. Not a chance that I could read a hundred or two hundred pages at a time on an LCD screen, but very doable with eInk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely ugly as hell. No getting around it. Very unfetching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to understand why they put on a keyboard &ndash; for buying and searching, mostly &ndash; but think it&rsquo;s not a completely necessary component. I&rsquo;d prefer a smaller device or a larger screen. But we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the wireless was necessary. I tether my various iPods to my computer all the time - and since I only get a few books a week, that would work fine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line, though: this isn&rsquo;t the ultimate eReader &ndash; absolutely, and of course. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it will make my own life a lot better in many ways,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I don&rsquo;t mind not having the physical books &ndash; and I actually like it. I hope that this evolves in a less proprietary way than, say, video, where we&rsquo;re all screwed, but think that this offering is a first step in that direction.</p>

			 <p>well, i think i&rsquo;m asking for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kindle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for christmas. i&rsquo;ve been dying for an e-reader for a while now &ndash; i carry sooooo much extra poundage around when i travel &ndash; always 2 or 3 books, just in case my mood changes, i finish the one i&rsquo;m reading, etc. so this is a really welcome development.</p>
<p>2 things stand out: (1) pricing &ndash; at $9.99 or less, ebooks are finally at a price advantage (the way that they should be) &ndash; with a $400 kindle price, i&rsquo;ll recoup that investment after buying about 40 books, or what i do in a year, more or less, and (2) title availability &ndash; i&rsquo;ll do a scan of my &ldquo;to read&rdquo; bookshelf when i get home, but first glance suggests that 80% of what i read is already available on Amazon. pretty good.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not perfect, i think. first of all, it&rsquo;s incredibly ugly. ugh. second, i don&rsquo;t think my books, on the whole, really need a keyboard. whatever. the wireless is neat, but as my canuck friends pointed out, it&rsquo;s US-only, which is a bit of a drag. (although, to be honest, this is a theoretical bad thing to me, but not really a practical one.)</p>
<p>other things: screen looks like it probably could be bigger; don&rsquo;t think their $13.99 NYT monthly subscription will compete with, um, free on the web. their ability to view .docs and .pdfs is dumb &ndash; you have to pay amazon to translate them into kindle format. bah.</p>
<p>so far it&rsquo;s looking at lot like apple/iphone/itunes. super-great functionality, great pricing, completely closed technology &amp; stack, locking you to this vendor.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll say this: my media consumption habits are changing very very quickly now, across the board. if we can get this stuff to evolve more like the web and less like wireless carrier locked environments, life will be really good. pretty big if, though. (actually, i think it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;when,&rdquo; not an &ldquo;if,&rdquo; but a with a potentially long timeline.)</p>

One of my favorite authors, but I didn&rsquo;t really care for this book too much. Coupland is one of the best writers in the world at point of view &ndash; this story, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hey Nostradamus, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->which I liked a lot &ndash; is written from many, many different points of view. The way he does it is amazing &ndash; craft is in evidence here for sure. Lots of points of view within points of view (i.e. characters writing from other characters' points of view). But at the end of the day, I didn&rsquo;t care much about the characters, so the book was a disappointment for me. Hopefully next time.</p>

		<a href="https://johnolilly.com/2007/11/14/no-new-library-for-sunnyvale.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-11-15 13:53:28 &#43;0700">Nov 15, 2007</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week was election day &ndash; and one of the things I was really hoping would pass, Measure B to support building a new library here in Sunnyvale, lost. Lost big, actually: we needed 2/3 and only mustered 59%. That&rsquo;s a gigantic margin, and I think indicates broadbased opposition to the new building, or at least the $108M price tag.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit discouraged by the vote &ndash; the library that we have in Sunnyvale is way too small for the population it serves, and is nearly 50 years old. It&rsquo;s funny in that while I worked on the campaign and am also on the Library Board here, getting a new library doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of effect on my own life. I tend to buy my books, I tend to access the Internet, well, everywhere. But I think it&rsquo;s an important public good, so worth supporting.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think that I now believe that the combination of soaring construction costs, a general population who&rsquo;s losing touch with libraries (and maybe books), and a fiscally conservative city government taken together mean that Sunnyvale may never get a new library. Branches maybe, a bookmobile maybe. But I think this may mark the last opportunity to get a real central library built.</p>
<p>On reflection, I&rsquo;m not really sure whether I think that&rsquo;s a bad thing. I know that my personal relationship with books is changing. I&rsquo;m still reading a lot, of course, but I&rsquo;m consuming a larger percentage of my content either on the Internet now or in video form. I&rsquo;m starting to get annoyed that books are so heavy and take so much space in my house, not to mention that they&rsquo;re a pain to move. I really, really want the eReader that&rsquo;s coming from Amazon to be useful and have great content. I&rsquo;ll switch in a flash.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think more about what needs it is that libraries satisfy, and whether we can reasonably expect a building 30 years from now to satisfy needs then. It feels to me like our pace of change is speeding up now, and I hesitate to predict what public spaces for collaboration and learning will look like even 10 years from now. (A visit to university classrooms today is incredibly provocative for me &ndash; they&rsquo;re nothing like they were 15 years ago when I was there.)</p>
<p>So while I&rsquo;m disappointed that we didn&rsquo;t get the bond passed, I&rsquo;m now thinking it might be a good challenge/opportunity to try to escape the constraints of big buildings for libraries. What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve got you here: Jim Griffith, Sunnyvale resident and a friend of mine, did an incredible amount to try to get this bond passed. Phone banked every night. Raised a ton of money. Got a campaign headquarters and dozens of endorsements. Put up lawn signs. Wrote op-ed pieces. Went to meeting after meeting after meeting. Jim&rsquo;s work makes me hopeful that local government can work.</p>

			 <p>Just got to my hotel in Tokyo, going to take a shower then go to a meetup here with, hey &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other people who live near me in Silicon Valley!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> :-)</p>
<p>Really here to see Chibi and Kaori and Gen and Kohei and Joi and Nobu and other folks from Mozilla Japan as we think about what to do here in 2008. It&rsquo;s been fun and productive to work with the team here as they&rsquo;ve grown from just a couple of folks 2 years ago to a real office now. Japan is a tough culture/market to really crack for open source, but Chibi (Takita-san, head of Mozilla Japan) has worked hard on raising awareness of OSS here for years, and is making real headway. I&rsquo;m excited to talk with her, the board, and the rest of Mozilla Japan tomorrow.</p>
<p>But tonight, Web2 types. :-)</p>
<p>2 random tidbits: (1) in Japan, my iPhone seems to be an iPod &ndash; no connectivity at all, and (2) I haven&rsquo;t been here in a year or so, and am reminded what a great place Tokyo is. I&rsquo;ve been to lots of great places in the past couple of years &ndash; Tokyo really is one of the world&rsquo;s great cities, alongside London and Manhattan, in my view.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot the past day or so about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Noam Cohen&rsquo;s piece in the New York Times about Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s really been rattling around inside my head because it missed so much of the essence of what Mozilla is and what we&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s ostensibly a story about how Mozilla has sort of grown up &ndash; going from cute little underdog to corporate competitor. Here&rsquo;s one line: &ldquo;But in trying to build on this success, the Mozilla Foundation has come to resemble an investor-backed Silicon Valley start-up more than a scrappy collaborative underdog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: by trying to categorize Mozilla with simple labels (SV start-up, scrappy underdog, cold war proxy (!), corporation, open source project, on and on&hellip;), he&rsquo;s missing the point. Mozilla is a complicated thing, filled with tensions and subtleties.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re an open source project. We&rsquo;re also a set of companies around the world.</p>
<p>We have distributed decision making. We also make some centralized decisions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a non-profit. We also pay people competitive wages for the industry and the geographies that they live in.</p>
<p>Our mission is to keep the Internet a medium of participation by everyone. We also care about Firefox market share because that&rsquo;s our most useful tool at the moment to achieve the mission.</p>
<p>We do resemble a startup &ndash; we recruit talented techies who could work anywhere in the world, we work 24/7 on our technology, we participate in industry events. But we&rsquo;re trying to build an organization &ndash; and an idea &ndash; that can last 50 or 100 years, and can make the Internet experience better for all.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got business relationships with Google, Yahoo, Amazon, eBay and many others. But we prioritize the user experience over any business term.</p>
<p>We have a mission, but we also compete, in direct ways, for the hearts and minds and clicks of humans using the Internet.</p>
<p>We have a lot of money in the bank compared to any other open source project. We don&rsquo;t have much compared to anyone else who&rsquo;s generally considered competitive with us.</p>
<p>We donate money to other projects, but we also use money that we have to further our public benefit mission.</p>
<p>We build applications that people use &ndash; Firefox is one of them &ndash; but we also provide a technology platform with an open license that many, many developers have built great things on, commercial or otherwise.</p>
<p>I could go on and on and on. Mozilla doesn&rsquo;t fit into clean categories &ndash; it never has, in my view. It didn&rsquo;t fit neatly into a category when it started as an experiment at Netscape nearly a decade ago. It didn&rsquo;t fit neatly when the small team left AOL to start something completely new called the Mozilla Foundation. And it doesn&rsquo;t fit now, as an organization/company/project/product with more than 100 million people around the world using Firefox and with something approaching $100M in the bank.</p>
<p>I think it does a disservice to the project to over-constrain Mozilla with simple labels. I&rsquo;m glad that Noam got as many of the facts right as he did. And I&rsquo;m glad that more people are starting to tell the story about who Mozilla is and what it&rsquo;s trying to do in the world &ndash; it&rsquo;s an important story. We&rsquo;re trying to do a better job at helping folks understand the story, too, in all it&rsquo;s messy, complicated, contradictory and uncategorized glory.</p>

<p>Today is the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, so that means Voting Day in the US. It&rsquo;s an off-cycle year here, so no national offices on the ballot for another few months when the primaries start, which means most everything on the ballot is local issues: city and county level stuff. So most folks won&rsquo;t get out to the polls today; in Sunnyvale, fewer than 1 in 5 residents will vote.</p>
<p>Still in all, in my view, local elections matter to our daily civic life in a million different ways. They determine who sits on city council, who&rsquo;s the mayor, who sets the agenda. They define things like how zoning works, where you can build certain types of buildings, and what you can spend on schools. This particular election in Sunnyvale will determine whether or not we get a new library to replace our current lovely-but-50-year-old building. I&rsquo;ve worked a bit on that election (although not as much as Jim, who&rsquo;s completely blown me away with his dedication), and personally hope that we can get the new library bond passed. I think it&rsquo;s important for our citizens, our kids, and our community.</p>
<p>Anyway, I voted this morning, and was reminded, yet again, how important that I think local civic life is, and how while it can be a little bit frustrating for me because of the pace and the (relatively) small stakes, compared to my work life, participation in our local communities is probably the only real antidote to the disenfranchisement and disillusionment that seems so commonplace today.</p>
<p>So whatever your views are, I hope you&rsquo;ll go vote today if it&rsquo;s happening where you live.</p>

			 <p>looks like the writers' guild strike is happening. i think my most basic emotion is that i&rsquo;m strangely sort of happy about it &ndash; not about the economic impact on the writers, which is not good at all, but i&rsquo;m happy that i don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to watch colbert &amp; daily show 4 times a week. isn&rsquo;t that strange? i could always have decided not to watch it, but this seems somehow easier. takes the bat out of my hands, so to speak.</p>
<p>anyway, i don&rsquo;t find the prospect of less television very disturbing (especially since season 5 of The Wire is already in the can and awaiting us in January).</p>
<p>i <em>do</em> think, though, that this strike &ndash; and people expect it to be a long one &ndash; will have a highly damaging effect on the quality of television shows. the last really major writers strike in 1988 left us with shows like America&rsquo;s Most Wanted and Cops, both of which heralded in a really crappy (and giant) genre of television. what will we get now?</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one of those things, i think. for the studios, this feels, to me, like their waterloo, their napster. we&rsquo;re in a period of incredible creativity in the world, incredible connectedness. putting down the hammer on the creatives &ndash; in other words, not letting them share fairly in the proceeds from the distribution of their work &ndash; isn&rsquo;t likely to help the television and motion picture industry, in my own, admittedly uninformed opinion.</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll see. maybe folks will pick up books. i do know that i&rsquo;m going to cut any television shows that i&rsquo;m watching that are marginal (i&rsquo;m looking at you, Pushing Daisies and Weeds, and maybe you, too, DirtySexyMoney), and endeavor not to add any reality junk that shows up when scripted shows run out in january.</p>

			 <p>so far so good. i put one of the last developer releases onto my macbook pro last thursday and have been happily using the new os x release since then. i had meant to do a clean install, but accidentally did an install over the top of tiger, and it works like a champ, honestly.</p>
<p>performance seems really good &ndash; most things are snappier than with 10.4 (i think). lots of little upgrades that make things better &ndash; smarter finder windows, better wireless UI, stuff like that.</p>
<p>the visual redesigns are driving me a little bit crazy &ndash; in particular all the stuff where they&rsquo;re showing off new effects. the sort-of-but-not-really-translucent menu bar is driving me a little bit crazy, but the translucent menus everywhere are the most annoying thing in the whole system &ndash; i just don&rsquo;t understand why anyone thinks that&rsquo;s a good idea. they&rsquo;re not super-translucent, but enough so that the stuff behind them really impacts legibility of menu choices. it&rsquo;s a bummer.</p>
<p>the new dock is mostly just silly. shadows &amp; reflections everywhere. shiny effects, but mostly distracting, honestly.</p>
<p>calendar has been pretty completely reworked, and it&rsquo;s a much more refined look now. i&rsquo;m finding it not quite as readable as it used to be because there&rsquo;s no active calendar notion anymore (where the appointments would be dark color backgrounds with bold white text) but just the active item. but on the whole, better.</p>
<p>mail has gotten a lot better, i think. more refined visually, although still with the icky lozenge buttons. you can drag top level folders around in the sidebar now, which is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->much<!-- raw HTML omitted --> better. there&rsquo;s an activity display that tells you what&rsquo;s happening on the network now (very helpful). i like the RSS subscription capability &ndash; i&rsquo;ve subscribed to a small number of feeds that i treat more like my e-mail workflow, and it&rsquo;s working great, although html display doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working. for me, the jury is out on To Dos and Notes. we&rsquo;ll see. data detectors are neat (they give context menus on things like phone numbers &amp; addresses, but are a little subtle for me &ndash; i keep forgetting they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m unsure about time machine yet. backed up over the weekend, but don&rsquo;t have enough incrementals to know whether i like the user interface or not yet. (early best guess: i think they&rsquo;ve done an admirable job in making backup easy to understand, but their tools are miserable for actually finding something you&rsquo;ve lost.)</p>
<p>coverflow is visually stunning, and basically useless. not just in itunes, but everywhere, in my opinion.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll have more thoughts before too long. but for now, seems like a good upgrade &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t yet feel like a completely new OS. feels decidedly incremental, although i think that will start to change as new applications get released from 3rd party developers using things like Core Animation.</p>
<p>i also think, fwiw, that the user interface on the Mac is both good and starting to get a little bit confused. toolbars are incredibly inconsistent, even from one Apple application to another, let alone 3rd parties. i think it&rsquo;s going to get a lot more jumbled for a while, as developers start to throw in HUDs and animations for everything, and as we start to get more and more direct manipulation with rich media types. (in the coverflow view of the new finder, for example, you can flip through the pages of PDFs, play movies, etc.) i have a feeling there&rsquo;s going to be a large amount of experimentation with new styles of interaction now. i think, also, that it&rsquo;s going to be influenced more &amp; more by flingable interactions like on the iPhone.</p>
<p>anyway, so far so good.</p>

			 <p>just a quickie for this morning &ndash; my son SPL (trying not to use his name in public blogs anymore) is just over 2, and he&rsquo;s getting more and more verbal all the time, and lately has really started singing songs from his various school activities a lot. the past couple of mornings have been really funny &ndash; about 2 minutes after we get up, he starts singing his Mandarin songs (he goes to a Mandarin music class once a week). so at 6:30 in the morning, when it&rsquo;s literally still dark outside, he&rsquo;s doing parachute time in chinese. it&rsquo;s awesome. my favorite one is some sort of marching song, where he marches around and says &ldquo;Yi Er. Yi Er.&rdquo; (&ldquo;1 2 1 2&rdquo;) &ndash; he could do it for hours.</p>
<p>not sure how my life got to a point where my son marches around the living room in the morning darkness singing in Chinese, but it&rsquo;s a pretty funny way to start the day&hellip;</p>

			 <p>We have so many things going on at Mozilla that it&rsquo;s tough to keep track of them all &ndash; and by personality, I tend to focus on all the areas that need work, more than I focus on all the stuff that&rsquo;s working great. (for confirmation, check <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this recent post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)</p>
<p>So it really cheered me up today to see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Li&rsquo;s post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla Manifesto<!-- raw HTML omitted --> translated into Chinese.</p>
<p>Our work in China is something that&rsquo;s gone incredibly well this year &ndash; at the start of this year we had a very small market share there (something like 0.5%), and no team really focusing on it (but a community that was ready to be energized). But Li is doing great &ndash; we&rsquo;ve got an office and a small full-time team working hard now, we&rsquo;re working hard to engage the community, and our market share has at least tripled, to something between 1.5% and 2%. This is really good news, because getting to 5 or 6% market share will mean that a whole lot more sites in China will start testing against and working with Firefox.</p>
<p>I personally have learned a ton about China through this work &ndash; have gotten to go meet some interesting and amazing folks (including our own team there) 3 times, and am looking forward to more visits. Notwithstanding <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ongoing weirdness with redirects there<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,  the Chinese consumer Internet is being shaped right now, and I&rsquo;m excited we have an opportunity to make a difference.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be incredibly interested to watch reaction to the Mozilla Manifesto there.</p>

<p>Okay, the good news is that we don&rsquo;t actually have moles in our front yard. The medium-to-bad news is that we have gophers. Or, rather, gopher (singular), we think. A new piece of home lawn care trivia: moles present as big mounds of dirt in your front yard. Gophers present as a gradual &amp; widening area of dead grass and soft spots in your lawn. And moles are carnivores, looking for grubs &amp; such, while gophers are vegetarians, only hoping to eat the roots of all the plant life that you love.</p>
<p>Somehow I&rsquo;m comforted by the thought that it&rsquo;s a gopher and not moles, and not just because I feel an affinity with Bill Murray now. Somehow <!-- raw HTML omitted -->moles<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seem incredibly alien &amp; unknowable to me, while gophers seem more like your friendly mammal-next-door.</p>
<p>All the same, my favorite gopher is a dead gopher, at least in the vicinity of my front yard, so we&rsquo;ve set a trap for the critter, so we&rsquo;ll see how it goes. (Yes, I know that this is an incredibly unhip and unfriendly post to write on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blog Action Day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it&rsquo;s eating my yard, man. Gotta get this fixed. FWIW, our &ldquo;mole guy&rdquo; is a super-smart &amp; friendly entomologist from UCSC who&rsquo;s found that Silicon Valley types (and Woodside folks in particular) are happy to pay $55 per critter for removal.)</p>

<p>Great, great book. I didn&rsquo;t really mean to read this &ndash; but I was at Logan a couple of weeks ago with nothing to read (a very strange happenstance for me), and this was the best thing I could find to read at the bookstore there. I&rsquo;m really happy I picked it up &ndash; fantastic look at why Americans eat the way we do, how food gets to us, and some of the implications of living the way that we do. 3 sections: (1) the industrial food chain, (2) organic (both industrial organic and local organic), and (3) hunting &amp; gathering.</p>
<p>The book is full of little tidbits that I didn&rsquo;t really know &ndash; things like how &ldquo;super-sizing&rdquo; came to exist, that we didn&rsquo;t have high fructose corn syrup until 1980, and how morels appear in forests following fires as a crisis defense mechanism.</p>
<p>But also full of major themes like why corn completely, totally dominates our food chain (and it does in ways that are much more pervasive than I really thought). And the ethics of meat eating. (For the author, he ultimately decided he thinks there&rsquo;s nothing particularly wrong with the philosophy of eating meet, but there&rsquo;s much wrong with the practice of how we do it today.</p>
<p>Anyway, lots and lots of great insights here and things to think about &ndash; has already affected the way that I notice the world around me. And has made me a little ill every time I think of all the corn I&rsquo;m eating now. (It&rsquo;s everywhere!)</p>

			 <p>As all regular readers of this blog know, I&rsquo;m an unabashed fan of robots. (The Isaac Asimov be-good-to-humans type, not the Will Smith human-killing type, although that type has a certain attraction at times.)</p>
<p>Okay, not really. I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve ever even written about them here.</p>
<p>But I bought a Scooba for our kitchen this week &ndash; life with a two year old entails a certain amount of ever-present crumbs on the kitchen floor (among other places), which in turn means a fair bit of sweeping &amp; mopping. So I figured a robot sweeper/mopper would be perfect. (As an added bonus, it provides exactly the type of entertainment a 2 year old boy is looking for.)</p>
<p>Alas.</p>
<p>We tried it out last night, and it pretty much was a failure. Sorta mopped okay, sorta swept up okay, but was incredibly loud and pretty slow. I had visions of us unleashing little Scooba each night to eat up the leftovers, sort of like the vacuum from The Jetsons. But way too noisy for that to work.</p>
<p>If any robots are reading this blog, hear this: you need to step up your game, or you&rsquo;ll never be our overlords on earth. Come on, robots.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s funny the way these things go.</p>
<p>Today was an extraordinary day for me here at the WEF meeting in Dalian. I had a 1-1 half hour conversation with Tom Friedman (we talked about a bunch of stuff, including the fact that we&rsquo;re all transparent humans now in the public eye, and that we need to learn again how to read &ndash; incidentally, watch for his next column, as it will be a bit about Dalian), spent an hour talking with Jimmy Wales (founder of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), talked with my friends <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Isaac Mao<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kaiser Kuo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, preeminent bloggers in China, kidded around with the founders of probably a dozen incredibly awesome startups, met <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rebecca McKinnon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (formerly CNN Correspondent for northeast Asia including North Korea), and spent time with my new friend Chris, whose design firm is involved in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->especially this<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not to mention probably two dozen other extraordinary people I met for the first time. Oh, right, and I had drinks at the reception with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->friggin astronaut<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who&rsquo;s now trying to save the earth&rsquo;s water.</p>
<p>So all in, a good day. An amazing range of experiences and an amazing range of people to spend time with. As I mentioned, I feel very lucky.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the really amazing thing: as blown away as I am by all these folks, every single one of them knows Mozilla and Firefox and is rooting for us. Not everyone uses Firefox, although most do (1 Maxthon user, 1 Safari user, the rest use Firefox). But every single person I talked with thinks that what the Mozilla community has accomplished is incredible, and wants to see us do better and better.</p>
<p>So the funny bit for me is that sometimes you have to go 5,000 miles (literally &amp; figuratively) to really be reminded how amazing the people around you are, and how lucky you are to get to work with them every single day. [This also applies to my family, of course &ndash; I can&rsquo;t wait to get home to see Kathy &amp; Sam.]</p>
<p>Everyone involved in any way with Mozilla should be proud of the impact we&rsquo;re having on the world &ndash; an awful lot of awfully amazing people are noticing &amp; cheering &amp; helping.</p>

			 <p>I was one of the discussion leaders in a session yesterday (at the World Economic Forum meeting here in Dalian, China) on what new technology companies are doing to disrupt existing businesses (and a fun/great conversation from a media mogul from the UK who&rsquo;s very frustrated about valuations of companies he thinks have no real business except for taking margins to 0 &ndash; that&rsquo;s sorta the way we roll in Silicon Valley.)</p>
<p>Anyhoo, the session was led by the most excellent John Gage from Sun Micro, and as he was setting up the ideas for the session, he showed a bunch of web pages from his Mac, using SeaMonkey (which he used because he wanted to edit the pages he was looking at). Was a great, unintentional example of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Mozilla is disrupting &ndash; was really awesome when my intro came around and I explained that while John said that SM came from Mozilla, that it really came from a committed group of volunteers around the world &ndash; and shows the strength of the model.</p>

			 <p>This&rsquo;ll be a little bit short, as I&rsquo;m in Beijing at 3a trying to fight off jetlag (here&rsquo;s a tip: when you wake up at 2a, don&rsquo;t turn on your computer!), but wanted to post something about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eudora 8 beta release<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that&rsquo;s recently gone up on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mozilla.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>A lot of folks, including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ars Technica<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TechCrunch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, are reporting that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mozilla reviving Eudora,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s incorrect, and I think a disservice to the Eudora team at Qualcomm, led by Steve Dorner.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s come out today is the outcome of work by the Eudora team at Qualcomm to migrate from their venerable code base (I used and loved Eudora myself for maybe 10 years, and still miss some things about it) to an open source framework &ndash; in other words, it&rsquo;s an extension built on top of Thunderbird. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is not a new release of a mail client from Mozilla. It is a community project led by the Qualcomm team.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I think this will be an interesting thing to see unfold &ndash; how much people care about differences in the UI layer for e-mail clients, and how much you can really do in XUL on top of Thunderbird&rsquo;s way of interacting, so I&rsquo;ll be curious to see how folks respond.</p>
<p>For now, though, just wanted to clear things up. When I first met Steve &amp; Co at Qualcomm last year, I felt very lucky to spend time with them &ndash; those few individuals probably had more impact on my work life during school &amp; afterwards than any other development team. I&rsquo;m blown away that their commitment to their users extends beyond their own code base, and that they&rsquo;re working hard to make sure that Eudora users have a road ahead based on open source and a new growing community.</p>
<p>Signing off from Beijing&hellip;</p>

			 <p>CNet&rsquo;s Crave has a great writeup on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->performance of Fusion versus Parallels for Windows virtualization<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the Mac. I&rsquo;ve been excited since Parallels came out about this &ndash; especially for my work at Mozilla, it&rsquo;s fantastic, as it means I can take a look at Windows builds of Firefox, other apps, etc &ndash; all with my MacBook Pro. As much as I like Parallels, though, I&rsquo;ve found its performance erratic &ndash; and at times it overwhelmed my system resources. I&rsquo;ve been trying Fusion lately, and my experience has been a lot better. It seems to perform better, and it&rsquo;s much better behaved with respect to running other applications. Parallels has a better UI, I think, and its &ldquo;coherence&rdquo; mode seems to be better than Fusion&rsquo;s &ldquo;unity&rdquo; mode. But I found using Parallels that I&rsquo;d often have to restart my machine to get performance back okay &ndash; Fusion so far seems a lot better, so I&rsquo;m going to stick with it for a bit.</p>

<p>This is a special opportunity, I think. I joined Mozilla 2 years ago when we were just 15 or so folks, and my title was Business Development lead &ndash; even though we didn&rsquo;t really know what it meant. But in the 2 years since then, I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to be part of something unique &amp; great &ndash; the growth of Mozilla.  FWIW, I had only generic business/entrepreneurial background before joining to do BD &ndash; but was able to work with Chris Beard, Mitchell Baker and others here to build something of an ecosystem of partners, and to help make our economics more sustainable.</p>
<p>At PCF, there&rsquo;s a similar type of opportunity &ndash; but even more at the ground floor &ndash; the opportunity is to figure out open video from the beginning, and to mix the business, open source, and non-profit angles all together.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in making sure that the future of video on the web stays open, I&rsquo;d encourage you to take a look.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll refrain from writing a review of HP7 (I liked it quite a bit), but wanted to note a new feeling for me &ndash; as I was reading this book, I started to imagine, for the first time, what it might feel like in 7 or 8 years when Sam reads the series for the first time. It&rsquo;s fun to do that &ndash; fun to think about the types of conversations we&rsquo;ll have, the questions he&rsquo;ll have, and the learning he&rsquo;ll do. HP6 came out about a week after Sam was born &ndash; so a lot of it hadn&rsquo;t really sunk in yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the basic emotion of thinking back to when I read Tolkein for the first time &ndash; read my parents' old editions of them, naturally &ndash; and it was fun to discover this whole new world that Mom &amp; Dad already knew about. Same for CS Lewis.  And that stuff is awesome &ndash; I can&rsquo;t really wait. Kathy &amp; I already love helping Sam as he develops his sense of humor.</p>
<p>But the collateral effect is that I found myself often wondering about what it was that JK was trying to communicate &ndash; what she was trying to help her readers understand.  So I really started appreciating some of the things she was trying to do, and appreciating her craft more than I had done previously.  That&rsquo;s a pretty tremendous gift that I&rsquo;ve gotten from Sam already &ndash; and has applicability far beyond just Harry Potter or even books.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also fun to think about the characters that we all grow up with &ndash; the people and places and ideas that become part of growing up, learning how the world works, learning who we are. I think about the persistent characters in my life &ndash; Bilbo &amp; Frodo Baggins, Gollum, Darth Vader, Kermit the Frog, Big Bird, Animal, Aslan, Winnie the Pooh &ndash; and wonder which ones Sam will know &amp; care about &ndash; which ones will be real for him. Maybe Elmo and Bob the Builder and SpongeBob and Harry Potter &ndash; who knows. But I&rsquo;m excited to find out.</p>

			 <p>i&rsquo;ve been playing around a bit with the new iWork for a few minutes to get first impressions, but only have a few minutes left on my battery&hellip;</p>
<p>but my first thoughts are these:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>keynote is mostly the same. the auto-alpha stuff is going to be really, really handy for cleaning up graphics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pages seems to have been considerably de-sucked. in fact, it may not actually suck anymore, although i&rsquo;m not prepared to pronounce it non-sucking. word processing mode is a huge leap forward, if not actually an innovation, and change tracking looks like it works (and it looks beautiful, fwiw)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numbers is going to take some time to get my head around. i <em>think</em> it&rsquo;s a spreadsheet that&rsquo;s more about communicating than figuring, but we&rsquo;ll see. the expressiveness there is shockingly good, and, as usual, it looks fantastic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>anyway, more soon. this release is going to be a little brutal for the Mac BU of Microsoft.</p>
<p>(i still would really like these rich client apps to auto-save to something like Google Apps on the server side.)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve got about 15 different posts half-written in my head about my first 3 weeks with my iPhone, but wanted to write quickly about how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->human<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a device it is. It&rsquo;s hard to explain why, but when I get a call, say, from Kathy, and there&rsquo;s a large, high quality picture of her &amp; SPL on my phone, my emotional reaction is wonderful. And I feel that way about a lot of the phone &ndash; Kathy &amp; SPL &amp; I routinely flip through photos from the past few years &ndash; even SPL, who just turned 2, can flick from picture to picture, and back again. It&rsquo;s stunning, actually. Flinging pictures, lists, web pages around &ndash; it&rsquo;s really fun &ndash; and it feels <!-- raw HTML omitted -->direct<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s making using the mouse with my desktop feel extremely intermediated &ndash; like I&rsquo;m not really interacting with it at all, but directing some robot to do it.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that it&rsquo;s going to cause a very funny consequence &ndash; I think that all sorts of software/hardware vendors are going to start making their UIs flickable, flingable, draggable &ndash; and, very often, in incredibly inappropriate ways. Sort of like when everyone thought that &ldquo;drag and drop&rdquo; was always appropriate for everything, when sometimes it just wasn&rsquo;t (isn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Anyway, after 3 weeks, I have a high level of attachment to the iPhone. I&rsquo;m about to get on a plane to London, and will need to switch back to my Blackberry Pearl &ndash; more about that in a posting soon &ndash; and already I&rsquo;m feeling a little sad about it.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to say tat this is a tough book to  and a tough book to really know what to make of it. The subtitle is &ldquo;Memoirs of a Boy Soldier&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s about Ishmael&rsquo;s childhood in Sierra Leone, and his extremely quick trip from living with his family to killing people in the name of &hellip; well, in the name of something. Kathy &amp; I saw Ishmael on The Daily Show, and were taken with his poise and maturity &ndash; and his wisdom, of course. This is a guy who&rsquo;s in his twenties now, living in Manhattan, but in the past 20 years has gone from living in a tiny town in Sierra Leone to killing many, many innocent people while addicted to drugs and under the control of a military, to writing a book and trying to help others understand how impossible the situation is. It&rsquo;s not the best-written book that I&rsquo;ve ever read, but if even a fraction of it is true &ndash; and I have a sad suspicion that it&rsquo;s all true &ndash; it&rsquo;s mind-boggling that people have to go through this, and that people like Ishmael can survive.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll tell you that time is a tough thing for me to figure out these days.

<p>I&rsquo;m finding it both harder to really understand how I feel about time lately, and easier to just enjoy its passing. Yesterday was a rocky day, with the aforementioned naplessness &ndash; and SPL subsequently falling asleep in my arms when we walked around the block later. But after a short nap &amp; dinner, the two of us just kicked around the backyard, throwing the frisbee &amp; kicking the soccer ball &ndash; and time could have stood still, for all I noticed. It was just a sweet, carefree bit of experience we shared &ndash; the type of time that I&rsquo;m learning to appreciate more &amp; more.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After Dark<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a novel by one of my half dozen favorite authors, Haruki Murakami (translated from the Japanese by Jay Rubin). I was surprised to find an article this morning in one of the blogs I read about China &ndash; this is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an interview with the writer in China<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who translates Murakami&rsquo;s work into Chinese. This is something that never occurred to me, really &ndash; I always think of Murakami as fundamentally Japanese, but with American notes &ndash; and to think of him from a new perspective, particularly the Chinese angle, which he writes about some &ndash; is really eye-opening for me. Great interview.</p>
<p>Another <!-- raw HTML omitted -->essay by Murakami in the New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this weekend is great &ndash; it talks about how he writes like jazz.  My favorite bit of the interview is Murakami quoting great jazz pianist Thelonious Monk:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After Dark<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is good so far, but not my favorite. It takes place in the midnight-to-morning hours of Tokyo after the trains have stopped running. Sorta like Murakami&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eyes Wide Shut.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll see how the 2nd half goes.</p>

<p>Anyway,  this series is a great achievement &ndash; there&rsquo;s an innocence that we don&rsquo;t seem to have much of anymore, but also no shying away from tragedy.

			 <p>ugh. something possessed me today to go through all my milk crates of old power adapters &amp; cables. speaker wire, rca cables, power adapters for nokia phones, for motorola phones. old routers. ugh. i&rsquo;ve always been a guy who likes cleaning house, likes throwing away stuff to make room for the new, but this is hard.</p>
<p>getting rid of my original palm pilot sync cable &ndash; that&rsquo;s a pretty easy call, really. but my external apple scsi connector? what if someone comes over with a powerbook duo and an external dock for it, and then wants to connect an external scsi drive? what the heck would i do if i just tossed that cable? i&rsquo;d be in dire straits, that&rsquo;s what. nonetheless, i think i may part ways with it.</p>
<p>i go in fits like this every year or two &ndash; cleaning up stuff that i shouldn&rsquo;t have anymore, selling some stuff on ebay. just now i&rsquo;m trying to get my old dell laptop up &amp; running, buti seem to have misplaced the hard drive connector. i&rsquo;m sure i used it for something really useful, like prying open some other device i have. wonder where it is&hellip;</p>
<p>update: crap, dad says he threw away his external scsi cables a couple of weeks ago, so maybe i should keep mine, you know&hellip;just in case. i was sorta counting on him. and&hellip;when in the world did i use all these damn ethernet cables? thank god for WiFi.</p>

Greenfield moves from the basics of what&rsquo;s around us now, to what&rsquo;s coming (and why it&rsquo;s hard to tell), to how tricky it is to design experiences that work at all, to the ethics of how to design systems that are mostly hidden and will interact with each other on your behalf.</p>
<p>A lot of the content is stuff that I&rsquo;ve thought about for a long time, but I may be unusual, having spent time at places like Apple&rsquo;s research labs &amp; such &ndash; i did find myself thinking about all the computing that&rsquo;s in my house/life now &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s in the obvious computer form like our laptops or less obvious like our phones &amp; appliances.</p>

			 <p>After about a week with my iPhone, I&rsquo;m going to start writing up a series of thoughts about individual features of the thing &ndash; I&rsquo;ll start with talking about the keyboard, since it&rsquo;s central to the experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll not mince words: it&rsquo;s not a great experience. I&rsquo;ve had probably every sort of device since the Newton Messagepad &ndash; handwriting entry systems like that, Graffiti-based systems like the Palm, full keyboards like the Treo, phone keyboards with T9, and most recently the unusual 2 letters per key Blackberry Pearl keyboard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really been a very fast typist with any of these &ndash; and with the iPhone&rsquo;s virtual keyboard, I&rsquo;m getting to where I&rsquo;m generally as quick as with my Pearl, but it&rsquo;s pretty inconsistent. My left thumb overcompensates a little bit &ndash; I end up always tapping to the right of where I mean to &ndash; and both my thumbs end up obscuring a lot of the keyboard, of course &ndash; which matters especially much in this case because there&rsquo;s no tactile feedback.</p>
<p>But I find that mostly I&rsquo;m <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unsure <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of what I&rsquo;m typing, and as a result, I&rsquo;m tentative about it. Apple&rsquo;s done an interesting thing to address this: they enlarge the image of each key after you type it so you can be sure about what you&rsquo;re typing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> That definitely helps to know what letter you type &ndash; it helps a bunch, actually. But it interferes some cognitively with another more important piece of the experience: auto-correct.</p>
<p>Auto-correct &ndash; the phone knowing that I didn&rsquo;t mean to type &ldquo;Qppke&rdquo;, but instead &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; &ndash; is really, really great. It&rsquo;s the best that I&rsquo;ve ever used. I think it&rsquo;s partly because of the large dictionary and partly because they&rsquo;re doing something with key proximity &ndash; knowing that &ldquo;Q&rdquo; is close to &ldquo;A&rdquo;, for example. (I&rsquo;m not sure they really do that, but I suspect they do.) And the way that they&rsquo;re showing auto-correct &ndash; with an as-you-type suggestion box showing up under the word you&rsquo;re typing &ndash; works really well &ndash; tap on the box or the space bar to accept the suggestion, hit backspace or tap on the original word to keep what you&rsquo;re typing. (Tapping on the word you&rsquo;re typing that the iPhone doesn&rsquo;t recognize will also add it to the dictionary for the future, which is great, except that I just added &ldquo;Qppke&rdquo; to my dictionary and don&rsquo;t have any idea how to take it out again.)</p>
<p>The conflict that occurs is this: my eyes don&rsquo;t know what to look at &ndash; the animated images of the keys that I&rsquo;m typing or the constant stream of suggested words to fix my typos. So I end up moving my eyes back and forth from one to the other &ndash; which I&rsquo;m pretty sure is slowing me down. I have a feeling that if the keys weren&rsquo;t animated, I&rsquo;d instead stay focused on the text entry and be more efficient, but I don&rsquo;t know that for sure.</p>
<p>Apple &amp; apologists routinely say that the virtual keyboard is great because of the auto-correct experience &ndash; but it seems to me that they&rsquo;re completely orthogonal to each other &ndash; the auto-correct system could be implemented with a physical keyboard just as well.</p>
<p>I think things will also get a lot better when more of the applications on the phone will work in landscape mode &ndash; right now it&rsquo;s mostly Safari &amp; Photos that work that way &ndash; because a wider keyboard is really what you need. But it doesn&rsquo;t work in mail currently, so that&rsquo;s something for the future.</p>
<p>Another quibble with the keyboard is that the &ldquo;.&rdquo; and the &ldquo;,&rdquo; are hidden under the &ldquo;.?123&rdquo; mode key. I use both those keys all the time, and to have them be on the secondary keyboard is a little bit rough. Once you&rsquo;re in that punctuation &amp; number mode, though, you can get to a third screen full of symbols like international currency &amp; such &ndash; that&rsquo;s a decidedly useful thing.</p>
<p>On the whole, for me, it&rsquo;s a subpar keyboarding experience, but one that I&rsquo;m willing to put up with in order to get the large screen. I have a tough time imagining that most of the Blackberry set will ever be comfortable with it, though.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is an important book, by an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extremely important guy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; a Harvard biologist who happens to think that we might be screwing up our world pretty quickly. (Check out his awesome new project, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Encyclopedia of Life<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TED<!-- raw HTML omitted --> wish.) The book&rsquo;s central premise is that the communities of science and religion, so often portrayed as being at odds with each other, share a common cause: saving the earth.</p>
<p>This is obvious, of course. Wanting to save the earth because it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s creation or because of the incredible science in it &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not obvious to me is why this idea, this coalition, doesn&rsquo;t show up more. I have a sense that it&rsquo;s because religion in America has become politicized by the Right, and environmentalism has become politicized by the Left.</p>
<p>But something that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Larry Lessig<!-- raw HTML omitted --> said at a dinner I attended a year or so ago gives me some optimism: he said that coalitions (like today&rsquo;s on the Right) are always marked by unexpected collaborations &ndash; of groups that decide that one particular common cause is more important than any of their dozens of less important differences.</p>
<p>So maybe. Or perhaps the right word is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unless<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m taking a few days off to spend with my family, as SPL is getting ready for his 2nd birthday next week &ndash; this morning we&rsquo;ve gone for a walk to Starbucks (our normal routine), taken apart SPL&rsquo;s baby crib, and put together (most of) his new bed from Ikea. Need to take a trip back to Ikea to get the parts that we forgot yesterday, but should be in place by naptime, I think. He&rsquo;s really excited for his &ldquo;big boy bed&rdquo; &ndash; he has a new set of tools from his cousins (hammer, drill, pliers, etc) that he used to work on the bed with me this morning. Fun. Kathy got a fair number of pictures &amp; movies, so I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll post shortly.</p>
<p>Anyway, because of Independence day, this is my third day off, with a couple of weekend days to look forward to &ndash; I&rsquo;ve found that adjusting to &ldquo;kid time&rdquo; takes a couple of days &ndash; getting used to not being too worried about getting anything done on a timeline &ndash; but that once you&rsquo;re there it&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>
<p>2 is a tough age &ndash; lots of new capabilities, growing language &amp; understanding of the world, and lots of random emotions that are tough for a kid (and his parents) to sort out.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s such a generous, happy, funny kid that I know we&rsquo;ll miss this random time &ndash; such a good ime of exploration and coming into his own.</p>

			 <p>Weird problem today &ndash; I was watching a bit of video on my iPhone, then stopped &amp; went away for a while &ndash; it had more than 50% charge left when I walked away. When I came back, it was dead &ndash; felt warm to the touch. No buttons would work, black screen, nothing. Rebooting wouldn&rsquo;t work at all. I plugged it in for a while and after an hour or so it showed that it was charging again, but at about 5% &ndash; now, after charging most of the afternoon, looks like it&rsquo;s up over 90%.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Picked this book up after really enjoying Gawande&rsquo;s first effort, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Complications<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. He&rsquo;s a very thoughtful and articulate surgeon who works hard to help others understand what it means to be a doctor. In this book he focuses in particular on how docs try to be better. What they decide to measure and why. Starts with the story of current efforts to eradicate polio in India &ndash; I guess I had thought we had already done that, but of course that&rsquo;s smallpox that I was thinking of. Polio turns out to be more difficult, because it takes longer to present &ndash; and so it persists.</p>
<p>He makes a number of interesting points &ndash; about why measurement is important, and why there&rsquo;s always resistance to it. The story of the Apgar score is relevant to anyone with kiddos running around &ndash; such a simple idea, but one that clearly saves lives.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read anything by  Gawande before, you should probably start with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Complications, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as it&rsquo;s a more coherent &amp; better-written book. This one is interesting, but not the same level, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>

			 <p>my first full day of use suggests that battery life is gonna be a problem for me. it&rsquo;s 8:45p now, and i&rsquo;ve got maybe 10% of my battery life left &ndash; that&rsquo;s after leaving the house 13 hours ago (that&rsquo;s when i remember unplugging my phone).</p>
<p>having said that, the phone is showing 14 hours 18 minutes of standby time (which might be right, since it&rsquo;s about when i woke up this morning &ndash; very possible i started using it right away), and 6 hour 19 minutes of use, which i guess includes everything.</p>
<p>26 minutes on the phone, and about 6.3 MB of data received over EDGE and 1.1 MB sent.</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see what happens in the days ahead (and how much longer the phone lasts now), but i think this may be a problem for me. today, like all mondays, was an active day &ndash; i didn&rsquo;t get to sit much at my desk, and so was checking my mail a fair bit (and doing demos), but after about 4p, i found myself really watching the battery meter a lot and thinking that if i had been talking on the phone more or using the ipod more that it&rsquo;d be even lower.</p>
<p>i have a couple of ideas on why it depleted so quickly &ndash; i have 2 e-mail accounts set to check every 15 minutes, and mostly stayed within WiFi range of the office all day (and i have it set up to auto-join WiFi networks that it recognizes).</p>
<p>i <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the way the WiFi works is that it connects when it needs to (to check e-mail or something) and then disconnects after a period of inactivity &ndash; if WiFi drains significant power (and that&rsquo;s my guess) then i may have effectively kept the WiFi power drain on for most of the day. i may move e-mail checks to every 30 minutes and change the brightness setting a little bit for tomorrow &ndash; that would reduce the load, i think.</p>
<p>anyway, we&rsquo;ll see, but a little troubling for the first day. lots of other things i noticed &ndash; mostly i really like using it, and the pictures of my family on the main screen &amp; when they call really brighten my day &ndash; they&rsquo;re just shown in a vivid, fun way.</p>
<p>so hopefully i&rsquo;ll be able to figure out a way to get the battery life more workable&hellip;</p>

			 <p>3 things about the phone this morning:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>i really miss a few things from other devices &ndash; even back on my original palm pilot, there was a row of 4 application buttons &ndash; you could assign them to any applications. the iPhone would really benefit from those &ndash; 1 button access to calendar, mail, phone and ipod (or whatever 4 apps you want). i think there&rsquo;s plenty of room on the front to accommodate, and it&rsquo;d help a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t done a lot of testing on this yet, but seems like when you wake up the phone, it&rsquo;s connected to EDGE (naturally, since to receive calls you&rsquo;ve got to always be talking with cell towers), but the WiFi takes maybe 3-5 seconds to wake up. so for a guy like me, who wakes it up to check e-mails in a sadly OCD quick way, sometimes i get to checking mail before the faster connection kicks in, which results in a slower e-mail checking time than if i had taken longer to do the&hellip;um&hellip;what do you call these things&hellip;gestures? swipes? you know what i mean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s killing me a little bit that you can&rsquo;t rearrange icons on the home screen &ndash; that would help a lot very quickly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>i set up a Flickr contact this morning so that i can send pictures that i take to flickr automatically &ndash; but haven&rsquo;t gotten the flickr2blog stuff to work right yet. will play with that later.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>[i&rsquo;m going to categorize this with &ldquo;mozilla&rdquo; category as i think it&rsquo;ll be of general interest &amp; so should get syndicated on planet.mozilla.org, but for my future iPhone-related posts, won&rsquo;t do that unless folks really want me to. otherwise they&rsquo;ll be on my full feed or under the &ldquo;nerdTech&rdquo; and &ldquo;OSX&rdquo; categories.]</p>
<p>time to chime in with some early thoughts on my iPhone &ndash; got activated a few hours ago, after a 2nd set of calls to AT&amp;T. not really sure what the trouble was, and i&rsquo;ve got at least another call back to adjust a few other settings on my account. (#1 next question is whether or not my $69.99 blackberry world traveler data plan will work or not &ndash; it&rsquo;s important, as it gives me unlimited international roaming.)</p>
<p>anyway, first thoughts, in no particular order:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->the screen is terrific.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> everyone&rsquo;s reporting this, and everyone&rsquo;s right. great brightness, great resolution. movies look great, streaming videos look great. helvetica at this dot pitch looks remarkable. nice font choice.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->email is very very good.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it&rsquo;s not perfect &ndash; but i can read more e-mail, more quickly, than on any device that i&rsquo;ve had.  one weird side effect of having something that shares a lineage with mail.app is that when i get some HTML mails, and they&rsquo;re wide web pages, the mail reader on the iphone uses webkit and renders wide, mostly unreadable pages. which is related to the next point.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->when you open web pages, they&rsquo;re nearly always unreadable at first. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re showing you the full width of the page so you can figure out what to zoom in on. that was a hard choice to make, i think, as often you want to scan around the page to see what you want, but it makes the simple case of reading the main content not-so-simple. what would be ideal is if they implement per-site preferences for this, and i&rsquo;ll check that out.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->there are lists everywhere.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the phone, in mail, in videos. the list is pretty much the main organizational element. and like most everything, they&rsquo;re flingable. just fling your finger, and the lists to to what you want.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->visual voice mail rocks.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> i&rsquo;m not very good about dealing with my voice mail generally. i let it pile up. i don&rsquo;t like cleaning it out. i think it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s generally linear and i can&rsquo;t see it. visual voice mail on the iphone completely fixes that problem, and i think is transformative for me.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->there&rsquo;s a lot to fix with shortcuts &amp; such.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this doesn&rsquo;t feel like a brand new product offering to me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at all,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  but there are some things that are tricky to get to. for example, i&rsquo;m what i call a &ldquo;twitchy&rdquo; e-mail reader &ndash; OCD with e-mail, i&rsquo;ll light up my blackberry pretty frequently just to see if anything new&rsquo;s come in. but with the iphone, i&rsquo;ve got to press the on (or home) button, which brings me to the locked screen, the slide the slider to get to see whether i&rsquo;ve got actual stuff waiting. i think/hope they&rsquo;ll put a mail indicator on the front locked screen (and add an actual LED to future hardware revs).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->settings are slightly wacky, inconsistent &amp; unpredictable. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in lots of screens, you want to do something like change the way a list is displayed, add an account, change a font, etc &ndash; and there&rsquo;s often just no way to do it. or you have to do it through the overall settings screen. it&rsquo;s not a huge problem, but something that&rsquo;ll likely need to get addressed as the capabilities grow.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->jury is still out on safari.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the saying goes, this feels like the first mobile browser that&rsquo;s good enough to criticize. but i&rsquo;m going to wait on that. let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s a breakthrough, but still not what you want. that is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a criticism &ndash; i&rsquo;ve said many times at Mozilla that i think we&rsquo;re a the very beginning of interacting with the real web from smallish mobile devices and it&rsquo;s going to take a lot of time to really figure out. (this applies even for Japan, China, Korea &amp; Europe, where they&rsquo;re considerably more advanced than we are here on mobile.) they&rsquo;ve done great work on this version of Safari and have made some fearless decisions which i want to explore a little while longer before opining on.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->but the custom web widgets are pretty great. and fun, too. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->weather &amp; stocks, both small apps, work pretty much exactly like their OSX dashboard counterparts (modulo flinging the data around). google maps is, of course, wonderful. it makes me feel even more strongly that these types of widgetized, per application interfaces to Web data are going to be quite prevalent in mobile &ndash; much more useful than on the desktop.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->needs a purpose-built feedreader.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rss reading in safari isn&rsquo;t what you want. it&rsquo;s not great.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->seems really, really stable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> not crashy at all &ndash; google maps has crashed once on me, but in a very fast, not at all frustrating way. nothing else shows any hint of instability.</p>
<p>so i haven&rsquo;t really talked much about safari, any of the ipod stuff, calendar, or a host of other pieces, but think this is enough for now. i&rsquo;ll leave you with 2 thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->there&rsquo;s a ton of headroom here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> even with first generation hardware, there are a million things that apple can do to make this more and more useful. i guess we&rsquo;re not sure yet how frequently we&rsquo;ll see software updates, but i&rsquo;m optimistic. there&rsquo;s just a ton. in an &ldquo;imagine how great the future is&rdquo; way, not a &ldquo;to hell with this thing&rdquo; way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->the UE team absolutely deserves a medal on this.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> other teams do, too, including QA, packaging, etc, but UE is my own personal background, and it&rsquo;s such a hard thing to invent a user experience out of whole cloth that makes sense. they&rsquo;ve done that, with some rough edges, to be sure, but done it remarkably well. it&rsquo;s a solid &amp; usable UI, and it&rsquo;s really fun to use. the physics of the UI are really whimsical <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->useful and it&rsquo;s one of the best implementations i&rsquo;ve seen in a long time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>lots, lots more to talk about over the next few days &amp; weeks, but wanted to get my first thoughts down now.</p>

<p>Picked up this book as a recommendation from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EW Magazine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (piece of JOL trivia you don&rsquo;t care about is that this &amp; the Economist are the two magazines we subscribe to). Written by Larry Doyle, longtime Simpsons writer &amp; producer, it&rsquo;s a coming-of-age novel about graduation night, a nerd who thinks he&rsquo;s in love with one of the popular girls (Beth Cooper), and a bunch of teenage angst. Think of it as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fast Times At Ridgemont High <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for the new millennium. It&rsquo;s a fun summer read &ndash; nothing super-deep, but a pretty funny series of escalating adventures. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have picked it up if it hadn&rsquo;t been a Simpsons writer, and think I&rsquo;d probably pass on it while it&rsquo;s still in expensive hardback, but it&rsquo;s a fun book for an airplane or the beach or something.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;EDGE Network Speed&rdquo; is a bit of an oxymoron, but this morning, in advance of the iPhone launch, the speed I&rsquo;m seeing on my Blackberry is decidedly not-as-crappy as before. Much lower latency checking my mail; quicker page loads in the browser. Feels like maybe 3x - could be more, could be less. Hard to say.</p>

			 <p>the iPhone hype is starting to get to me. :-) i had pretty much decided i&rsquo;d get one, but likely not until the Autumn, once they&rsquo;ve had a chance to work out some of the inevitable kinks. but these reviews from mossberg &amp; levy et al are soooooo happy shiny, that it&rsquo;s breaking down my resolve.</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m pretty sure i&rsquo;ll still wait, and here&rsquo;s why: the 2 year contract. as the world is now, the folks who are in line now to buy a contract-subsidized $499/$599 phone will have contracts that won&rsquo;t expire until June 2009. which makes them early adopters now, but not so much for next generation. maybe that&rsquo;s okay &ndash; maybe this tech will be so incredible it&rsquo;ll last. and, probably, a year from now they&rsquo;ll be able to sign up for another 2 year contract to get a new subsidy for v2 or v3.</p>
<p>it just seems like there&rsquo;s so much in flux, so much that we&rsquo;re all learning about what mobile hardware &amp; software can do, that there&rsquo;s going to be a bunch of advances quickly. just take the physical layout, for example: i suspect that practical day-to-day use of the iPhone is going to drive putting 1 or 2 indicator LEDs on the hardware to indicate new e-mail or phone messages. maybe a physical button to get to a commonly used function quickly (here&rsquo;s one: the phone!). the software/OS bits seem much easier to me, but i suspect there will be some things there that will need new revs.</p>
<p>so it feels like what can/should happen is a secondary market for iPhones &ndash; that is, when v1.1 or v2 or v3 comes out, there should be a way that you can transfer your phone &amp; contract to someone else and get the new shiny. without SIM cards (that are accessible, anyway), this is a lot harder to do than it would be otherwise (and that would be a nice hardware modification for future versions, too!).</p>
<p>anyway, like everything else with the iPhone, who knows. it&rsquo;s a great step, obviously, and is going to be really attractive to me every time i walk by the increasingly ubiquitous Apple stores. but hopefully i&rsquo;ll be able to wait a bit and see how things play out.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scathing editorial in the New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this morning. Everyone should read it. Here&rsquo;s how it starts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;President Bush has turned the executive branch into a two-way mirror. They get to see everything Americans do: our telephone calls, e-mail, and all manner of personal information. And we get to see nothing about what they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>and  the big finish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Governments have to keep secrets. But this administration has grossly abused that trust, routinely using claims of national security to hide policies that are immoral and almost certainly illegal, to avoid embarrassment, and to pursue Mr. Bush’s dreams of an imperial presidency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It makes me so incredibly angry to be treated this way by our own government. And yet I feel that we&rsquo;re about to head into the 2008 election and make it just about petty politics again, instead of about fundamental directions of our government, and fundamental ways of operating that are being obliterated.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Well, now that I&rsquo;ve posted a video to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->She&rsquo;s So Hot (BOOM)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I&rsquo;ll post something a little more family-friendly &ndash; about the launch of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Glubble<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Glubble&rsquo;s the brainchild of Ian Hayward, a longtime friend of Mozilla, who contributed his own time &amp; his company&rsquo;s time over the past several years to help us build SpreadFirefox, the Joga extension, and others. He&rsquo;s obviously an important community member, and a devoted dad to his children &ndash; and that intersection is where Glubble comes in.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve built a pretty major extension for Firefox that enables kid-browsing. At the basic level, they&rsquo;ve built a UI on top of Firefox that simplifies the user interface for kids. You can recognize the basic elements of Firefox, with the back &amp; forward arrows, the URL bar and the search field, but it&rsquo;s of course simplified for smaller kids to use, with cool visual thumbnails at the top for quick navigation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In addition to the UI reworking, they&rsquo;ve implemented some whitelists &amp; search filtering, so you can make sure your kids are surfing stuff that&rsquo;s appropriate. But they&rsquo;ve also built in a communications mechanism &ndash; so that as your kids (inevitably) click on links that are outside their Glubble-world, you as a parent will get a message in your browser &ndash; at home, work &ndash; wherever you are &ndash; and it&rsquo;ll let you grant or deny access to what they&rsquo;re trying to look at (and clicks beyond if you want).</p>
<p>I think there are 2 particularly neat things about what they&rsquo;ve done here. The first is that Glubble isn&rsquo;t trying to dumb down the Web &ndash; they recognize that the whole Web is important &ndash; that the whole Web has legitimate and useful content on it, depending on context more than any particular key word. The second is that this is a whitelist <!-- raw HTML omitted -->combined with active parenting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->approach &ndash; which means that the parent should get more involved as the child surfs.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t be for everyone &ndash; our best guess is that at present, most of our users may not have kids &ndash; but I think it&rsquo;s a tremendously good addition for families. My wife &amp; I are thinking about this more and more for ourselves &ndash; we&rsquo;ve got a 2 year old at home, and he&rsquo;s been fascinated with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pictures from Wikipedia (Emu)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->videos from YouTube<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (mostly Moose &amp; Garbage Trucks) since he was maybe 9 months old. He&rsquo;s got his own (not-connected-to-anything) keyboard that he types e-mails to grandparents on, too. Wanting control on the Web can&rsquo;t be too far away, so I&rsquo;m glad that Glubble is thinking about it &amp; innovating in such great ways.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->McCarthy is one of my favorite writers, as I&rsquo;ve written about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. His prose is astounding, and the images he creates stay with you for a long time. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NY Times compares his writing favorably with Faulkner&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; and I have to say that it&rsquo;s more meaningful to me than anything I&rsquo;ve read by Faulkner, which I find, um&hellip;difficult.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All the Pretty Horses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the first novel in the Border Trilogy, which McCarthy started in the early 90s (the other two books are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Crossing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cities of the Plain<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). It&rsquo;s a series of Westerns set in the border country on the edges of Texas and Mexico.</p>
<p>This is a pretty simple story about a couple of adolescent cowboys who leave their homes in Texas to make their way as ranch hands in Mexico, and what happens when they get there. The prose is sometimes serene, sometimes sweeping, and sometimes very difficult, but this is a great book, like the others I&rsquo;ve read by McCarthy. It&rsquo;s not quite as staggering an achievement as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Road<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and doesn&rsquo;t have quite the pacing of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No Country for Old Men<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but is nonetheless excellent.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I keep circling back around to reading books about the US Supreme Court &ndash; it&rsquo;s a topic I&rsquo;ve been interested in for a while, most recently reading Rehnquist&rsquo;s history. This new book from Jeffrey Rosen that serves as a companion to a new PBS Series of the same name, is very good.</p>
<p>Rosen focuses on judicial temperament, more than judicial philosophy &ndash; in other words, he focused on the way that justices interacted with each other. The book is in 5 parts &ndash; the first 4 look at pairs of contemporaneous figures (mostly justices): Marshall &amp; Jefferson, Harlan &amp; Holmes, Black &amp; Douglas, and Rehnquist &amp; Scalia. It finishes up by taking a look at our current Chief, John Roberts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all good stuff. The Marshall-Jefferson was a very stormy one, but set up the basics of the way our judiciary works (establishing judicial review, which has proven handy throughout our history :-)). I&rsquo;d always assumed Oliver Wendell Holmes was an impeccable jurist &ndash; I suppose because so many things like schools are named after him &ndash; but it doesn&rsquo;t appear that that&rsquo;s true. The Civil Rights era of Black &amp; Douglas is amazing &ndash; and a real broadening of basic American rights, whether justified in the constitution or not. And the path of Scalia and Rehnquist is interesting for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m encouraged by the way that Rosen describes Roberts &ndash; as a Chief who&rsquo;s interested in the Court acting as a Court, instead of a collection of academics each with specific opinions. He&rsquo;s working hard to turn back the personalization of jurisprudence that goes hand in hand with the politics that threaten to overwhelm it.</p>
<p>Not my favorite book about the Court, but an interesting one nonetheless. If you have a few hours, though, I&rsquo;d really suggest you catch the PBS series &ndash; illuminating.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is something I&rsquo;m very excited about: at Tuesday evening&rsquo;s Sunnyvale City Council Meeting, the City Council voted to put a ballot measure on the November 2007 ballot asking voters to support a$108M bond measure that would allow us to build a new library for Sunnyvale &ndash; one to replace our 40+ year old library.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful library currently, and taken incredible care of by the staff, but it&rsquo;s time for something new, and I&rsquo;m incredibly excited to start working on getting support for the bond.</p>
<p>As some of you know, I&rsquo;m on the Board of Trustees for the Sunnyvale Library, and it was some (very small) amount of our work, plus the (very large amount of) work by Sunnyvale Library Staff &amp; the City Manager that got things this far, plus the will of a determined City Council.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll blog about it some more in the coming weeks, but likely not as a Board of Trustees member (my work in that capacity w/r/t the bond is done, I think), but as a member of a group that will be called something like &ldquo;Yes for Sunnyvale Libraries&rdquo; or something like that &ndash; to work to get this bond funded by the 2/3 vote that&rsquo;s required.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not done a campaign like this before, so am excited to get started.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not every day you get a chance to make a 30+ year impact &ndash; I feel very lucky to be involved now.</p>

			 <p>Well, getting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->digged<!-- raw HTML omitted --> makes for an exciting week. :-) In case there was any doubt, Digg can drive a lot of traffic. My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post about Steve&rsquo;s view of the browser world<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has generated a lot of good conversation, and I&rsquo;m happy it has, even if some of the headlines are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more inflammatory<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than I think the post was, or than I think. There are a ton of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great reactions<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the comments on the post are insightful &ndash; many that both agree or disagree, and make good, distinct points.</p>
<p>There are a few things I&rsquo;d like to clear up, though, in as direct a way as I can. (Rather than try to re-state any of the misinterpretations of what I said, I&rsquo;ll assert my positive views here.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like Apple and Apple products. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You&rsquo;ll just have to trust me when I report that we have more Macs in the house than we do people. iPods, too. They&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that Steve Jobs has made a ton of positive change in the industry.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Design matters again. DRM is dying. And I&rsquo;ve got all my music in my pocket.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that Safari coming to Windows is a good thing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> User choice is good. No doubt about it.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think competition in the browser world is fundamentally a good thing. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is great work being done by browser makers today, in all parts of the world, not just from Microsoft, Apple and Mozilla. Also great stuff like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Camino<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Opera<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maxthon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SeaMonkey,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shiira<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not to mention new types of non-traditional browsers like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Songbird<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (for music) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Miro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (for Video).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don&rsquo;t believe that Firefox deserves anything from anyone, except based on the value we deliver &ndash; we need to compete to stay relevant.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> We need to make Firefox better &amp; better, we need to help people understand why we do what we do. Absolutely, and we&rsquo;re working hard to do that.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox market share does matter.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> But maybe not for the reasons you think. The Mozilla mission is to keep the Web open &amp; innovative &ndash; that&rsquo;s our public benefit goal. To get further towards that goal, people have to care about Mozilla, of course, and Firefox market share is an important tool for that at the moment. But it&rsquo;s not an end in itself. It&rsquo;s not even really a revenue issue. We&rsquo;ve figured out reasonable sustainability strategies that don&rsquo;t rely overmuch on whether our share is 20% or 25%. And we&rsquo;re investing a lot of time and attention in places like China, where helping the Internet get better is the right thing to do, but won&rsquo;t result in obvious market share gains (because the Chinese market, and many Asian markets are notoriously undertracked at the moment).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the main point from my previous point: words and pictures matter. There are two basic possibilities for why Steve&rsquo;s slides looked the way they looked. The first possibility is that their actual intent is to make this a two browser world on all platforms (well, all the platforms they care about, which would be Windows &amp; OS X). I think that&rsquo;s not a wonderful strategic goal for them, but the market will decide (like with everything).</p>
<p>The second, more likely possibility is that it was a careless construction of the slides that show a transition from the current world with more than just IE &amp; Safari to a world with exactly two options. That it isn&rsquo;t what they were trying to say. Oops!</p>
<p>I think that the truth is actually somewhere in between &ndash; that as they started to think about how to draw an &ldquo;after&rdquo; picture, it was messy. That representing anything like the real world wouldn&rsquo;t show the impact that Apple wants to have, or the incredible diversity of what&rsquo;s likely to be the real after picture. It&rsquo;s much easier to say things in the language of the past &ndash; that users can just get their browser from Apple or Microsoft.</p>
<p>But by using mental models and language of the past &ndash; a past in which modes of distribution are controlled by a few players with global financial wherewithal &ndash; the large companies, the controlling parties are seeking to prolong control. It&rsquo;s an insidious way of thinking, because often you don&rsquo;t even realize you&rsquo;re doing it because it&rsquo;s not convenient to try to communicate or try to understand a complicated future where it&rsquo;s not Red against Blue, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->La Bamba versus La Costena<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Coke against Pepsi. And by letting others use these simplified 2 party models, whether intentional or not, we&rsquo;re all aiding &amp; abetting their dominance, whether it&rsquo;s good for people or not.</p>
<p>But the world is messy and complicated, and it&rsquo;s increasingly rare for something to be pure and simple. My friend Diego says that &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Web thinking is freedom thinking.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; But we have to protect that by calling out efforts to the contrary, whether they&rsquo;re intentional, accidental, or just because people don&rsquo;t take the time to draw the messy version of the picture.</p>

<p>Every so often though, as inspired as he is, he says something that betrays at best a blurry view of the real world, at worst an explicit intent to bring more of the world under directed control from Cupertino, and that happened Monday.</p>
<p>The big news, of course, is that Apple&rsquo;s releasing Safari on Windows &ndash; and although <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it&rsquo;s been a rough first few days for them<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and will get rougher), more choices are generally good for users, and so I&rsquo;m hopeful that they can work to produce a product of quality on Windows eventually. I&rsquo;m quite fond of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of course, and am very happy that people <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everywhere in the world<!-- raw HTML omitted --> continue to adopt our browser in increasing numbers.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a screen capture from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->keynote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of what Steve thinks the world looks like today (discussion starts at about 1:06 into the preso):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We could <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quibble with the numbers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but close enough. It doesn&rsquo;t give much credit to the large &amp; growing number of other quality browsers that are on the scene today, and certainly doesn&rsquo;t give any sophisticated understanding of the situation outside the United States, where things vary more. Close enough, though.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the graph that betrays the way that Steve, and by extension Apple, so often looks at the world:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>He said this: &ldquo;Well we dream big. We would love for Safari&rsquo;s marketshare to grow substantially. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d love.&rdquo; Aw, shucks.</p>
<p>Fantastic! Dream big! Imagine a world of&hellip;wait for it&hellip;access to the web controlled by 2 companies &ndash; and why not just go with the 2 dominant operating system vendors in the world.</p>
<p>But make no mistake: this wasn&rsquo;t a careless presentation, or an accidental omission of all the other browsers out there, or even a crummy marketing trick. Lots of words describe Steve &amp; his Stevenotes, but &ldquo;careless&rdquo; and &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; do not. This is, essentially, the way they&rsquo;re thinking about the problem, and shows the users they want to pick up.</p>
<p>There are a couple of problems, of course. The first is that this isn&rsquo;t really how the world is. The second is that, irrespective of Firefox, this isn&rsquo;t how the world should be.</p>
<p>First, it isn&rsquo;t really how the world is. The meteoric rise of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Creative Commons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Linux and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, among many other examples, shows that today&rsquo;s connected world is no longer constrained by the monopolies and duopolies and cartels of yesterday&rsquo;s distribution &ndash; of the publishers, studios, and OS vendors. Hundreds of millions of users, in every language around the world are now making new choices. That Apple doesn&rsquo;t feel this, even within the familiar reality-distortion-field confines of Moscone Center, illustrates much of the problem.</p>
<p>Second, it isn&rsquo;t how the world should be. Even if we could somehow put that movement back in the bottle &ndash; that a world of just Starbucks &amp; Peets, just Wal-mart &amp; Target, just Ford &amp; GM &ndash; that a world of tight control from a few companies is good, it&rsquo;s the wrong thing to do. It destroys participation, it destroys engagement, it destroys self-determination. And, ultimately, it wrecks the quality of the end-user experience, too. Remember (or heard about) when you had to get your phone from AT&amp;T? Good times.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my point, to be clear: another browser being available to more people is good. I&rsquo;m glad that Safari will be another option for users. (Watch for the Linux port Real Soon Now.) We&rsquo;ve never ever at Mozilla said that we care about Firefox market share at the expense of our more important goal: to keep the web open and a public resource. The web belongs to people, not companies.</p>
<p>This world view that Steve gave a glimpse into betrays their thinking: it&rsquo;s out-of-date, corporate-controlled, duopoly-oriented, not-the-web thinking. And it&rsquo;s not good for the web. Which is sort of moot, I think, because I don&rsquo;t think this 2 party world will really come to be.</p>
<p>Steve asserted Monday that Safari on Windows will overturn history, attract 100M new users, and revert the world to a 2 browser state. That remains to be seen, of course.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t bet on it.</p>

		<a href="https://johnolilly.com/2007/06/11/parallels-amp-coherence-plus-fusion.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-06-11 23:36:21 &#43;0700">Jun 11, 2007</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been using the beta of (now-released) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Parallels<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for about a week now, and I&rsquo;m really impressed by it. I&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->played around with most of the virtualization technologies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for OS X over the last year, and have really gone back and forth on them. I&rsquo;ve used Boot Camp for a while, in particular to get some familiarity with Vista, I&rsquo;ve used Parallels a bunch for personal reasons (to run Quicken on Windows, a far superior experience to Quicken on the Mac) and for work reasons (to test Firefox versions, mostly).</p>
<p>When it came out, I wasn&rsquo;t super-impressed with Coherence, a feature in Parallels that hides everything but for the application windows that you&rsquo;re working in, including the Windows desktop. But now, with this release, it&rsquo;s fantastic. I used it most of the weekend to work on updating my Quicken info, and it really felt much like Quicken was just another application on my Mac desktop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a little skeptical about Windows apps on Mac &ndash; just because there are so many OS-level services that modern OSes supply and modern applications depend on &ndash; that I never felt that application-level virtualization would work.  This approach &ndash; visually hiding the OS, except when you need it &ndash; falls short of application virtualization, but I think provides just about the best experience you could hope for. [caveat: the beta that I&rsquo;m using is a little crashy &ndash; we&rsquo;ll see what happens when I get around to upgrading to the release version.]</p>
<p>Performance is much better, too &ndash; in fact, I&rsquo;m running Vista on Parallels, and it&rsquo;s working great.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also included snapshots, which makes Parallels much more suitable for testing than previously &ndash; and the UI for them seems to be a good step forward.</p>
<p>One side note: I made the mistake of installing Google Desktop on my first instance of Vista, and it really, really made life suck. It&rsquo;s not exactly Google&rsquo;s fault &ndash; the Google indexing + Vista indexing was just completely maxing out my system. (And, in fact, Google has filed a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Justice Department complaint<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about just this thing, and it seems to me to have some merit.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, since I had Vista installations on my mind, I also tried out VMWare&rsquo;s Fusion Beta 4 &ndash; it seems to me that they&rsquo;re falling further behind Parallels, not catching up. I tried to use Unity (their name for Coherence), which is notable because it does the same thing, but, I guess, with drop shadows, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to work yet with Vista.</p>

			 <p>3 random thoughts for the morning:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been cool towards getting a first generation iPhone, not wanting my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pants to catch on fire<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. that&rsquo;s not fair, of course, as not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->every <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rev A piece of Apple hardware catches on fire &ndash; it&rsquo;s more like a 50% hit rate. but these commercials that i&rsquo;m seeing every night on whatever it is that i&rsquo;m watching &ndash; ESPN? FX? Comedy Central? I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but i&rsquo;m suspecting that maybe i&rsquo;m <!-- raw HTML omitted -->precisely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->their target demographic. anyway, these commercials are fantastic. they show off user experience, they highlight UI innovation, and they really clearly, provocatively, show off the things that this phone can do. they&rsquo;re amazing. i don&rsquo;t care at all about the music &amp; movies bit, but it&rsquo;s still really compelling. anyway, i don&rsquo;t know. i know i&rsquo;m not willing to stand in line now, so that means an early one is out of the question, but maybe in the fall. we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at starbucks this morning, probably half the people there were monkeying around with their blackberries/treos/windows mobile thingys. it felt to me like the weight had started to shift away from everyone bringing their laptops in towards working on mobile. it&rsquo;s a bad sample set for a couple of reasons (1: it&rsquo;s practically in the middle of the Googleplex, so nerd-friendly territory, and 2: morning time is &ldquo;waiting for your meeting to show up by reading mail on your phone&rdquo; time, at least for me &amp; people like me), but still, feels like something is happening in the US now, in spite of our stupid, closed carrier system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i have noticed that i really, really like it when other people are using wordpress for their blogs, because for every post, you can subscribe to an RSS feed of the comment stream. so if something interesting happens in a post, i can use what&rsquo;s essentially a time-expiring single use feed to track the (often more interesting) comment threads. that&rsquo;s a great use for feeds &ndash; throwaway sources of time-relevant information. they&rsquo;re not like the other feeds that i track, but still really useful to throw into newsfire.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I picked this book up not because I wanted to read about trees, but because I really enjoyed Preston&rsquo;s debut book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Hot Zone, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about ebola. His other stuff hasn&rsquo;t been as good, but I enjoyed this book &ndash; it&rsquo;s about the biggest living organisms on the planet &ndash; the redwoods in California. I&rsquo;ll say that I didn&rsquo;t really think he could put together an entire book about trees that would keep my interest, but this book is pretty good. There&rsquo;s a lot I didn&rsquo;t know about the redwoods &ndash; interesting stuff.</p>
<p>Like how about this: the tallest known trees in the world are in groves in Northern California whose location is kept a secret by the folks who study them. Or this: the very tallest tree known is about 370 feet tall (!) and growing every year. Scientists think the theoretical maximum height is about 420 feet. Or that some of these trees may predate the founding of Rome, nearly 3,000 years ago. Or that there are giant ecosystems that are at the tops of these trees <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that include animals found elsewhere only in the ocean. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wacky.</p>
<p>I guess what I found most interesting is how unknown the world of trees is. As a starter, we don&rsquo;t really know where the tallest tree in the world is. There&rsquo;s no easy way to measure them, except by eyeballing them, climbing them, then dropping a line down and measuring it. I mean, wtf? That&rsquo;s the best we can do? We live in a world where so much is known, reported, confirmed &ndash; the idea that there are things in the world that seem to be obvious &amp; right in front of us that we don&rsquo;t know at all &ndash; it&rsquo;s sort of encouraging to me somehow. The idea that it&rsquo;s a sort of inspired wandering around that leads to discovery &ndash; that&rsquo;s a little bit how I feel about what we&rsquo;re doing at Mozilla some days.</p>
<p>The story of the folks who dedicate their lives to this is great &ndash; people climb them, camp in them, sleep at the tops of them &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to really believe, but they say that at the tops of these trees there are effectively clearings that you can walk around in, the branches are so thick &ndash; with huckleberry bushes, multiple trunks per tree &ndash; a forest at the top of each tree, really.</p>
<p>Anyway, as a result, I think I&rsquo;d like to take a family trip to see the big trees sometime. I always used to hate trips like that when I was a kid, but now it seems interesting. Kathy has always liked this stuff better than me, though, so there&rsquo;s a chance Sam will like them, too.</p>
<p>Good book. One measure of a book&rsquo;s import to me is how much it changes the way I think about things &amp; look at the world, and by that measure, it&rsquo;s a great one.</p>
<p>Saturday I started on Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All the Pretty Horses. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of my favorite authors, but man is it a lot of work to read his writing. You just feel worn out afterwards. This one&rsquo;ll take me a while, but I&rsquo;ve got a backlog, so maybe I&rsquo;ll post some about other books I&rsquo;ve read this year in the meantime. About 20 books on my queue now. Sigh. 2 by Haruki Murakami, one of my very favorites. Gotta clear the queue before 7/21.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;ve been working over the past couple of months with a some students in a Stanford class in Management Science &amp; Engineering taught by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tom Kosnik <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(who I&rsquo;ve known for about a million years, give or take) &ndash; looking at places in the world where Internet adoption is strong &amp; rising, and mapping against places where Mozilla is strong.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting chart that they created a little while back:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The blue lines represent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Internet World&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stats on # of Internet users in each country in March; the yellow percentages on the bars represent what WebSideStory thinks is Firefox market share in each (WSS has pretty consistently been the lowest of the market share reporters on Firefox &ndash; we believe our share in most cases is one or two or more points higher &ndash; take those stats and the overall Internet population stats with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->grain of salt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>We know a few more things than are shown here &ndash; we think that our market share in China, for example, is a little north of 1%. In Taiwan, we believe it&rsquo;s something more like 6%. Korea&rsquo;s tough for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->historical reasons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And for us, we&rsquo;ve got great strength in the 247M people who represent &ldquo;Rest of the World&rdquo;, in places like Poland, Finland and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Obviously, the mass of our users still comes from the US, and that&rsquo;s reflected in our own <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chart  of usage<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I felt that this was a great visualization from the Stanford folks to highlight both how much progress a small team has done, and how much we have left to do. I&rsquo;ll see if I can find some correlating numbers from other sources to give a more balanced picture in the next few days.</p>

			 <p>We have a few things we keep an eye on here at Mozilla &ndash; one of them is where in the world our users are coming from &ndash; or, more specifically, what language version of Firefox they&rsquo;re using. In particular, I&rsquo;ve been watching this lately because the % of our users using the en-US (English, United States version) has been right at 50% for a while &ndash; and yesterday, for the first time, it went under half, to 49%, which means that we no longer have an English/US majority of users &ndash; and, in fact, have no particular language that&rsquo;s in the minority. (In truth, our en-GB &ndash; English, Great Britain &ndash; version accounts for about 4% still, so we&rsquo;re still English-language in the majority.)</p>
<p>This represents a ton of hard work by communities around the world &ndash; obviously our German &amp; French communities are exceptionally strong as well, with the rest of Europe also making gains. Brazil is our most significant user population outside of North America &amp; Europe, followed by Japan. But the fastest growth is coming from &ldquo;other&rdquo; &ndash; our long tail of languages. I&rsquo;ll grab some more information over the next few weeks to talk about growth rates &amp; what composes other, but thought I should highlight this milestone now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very proud of Mozilla to get to this point, and think it shows something very special about the global nature of what we&rsquo;re up to.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting week in the Mozilla blogosphere. So much conversation, explanation, accusation, retraction, questioning, talking, talking, talking. One of the clear examples of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->leverage<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I spent a while writing about on Sunday. It&rsquo;s one of the brilliances of what mozilla.org set up around a decade ago &ndash; conversations are happening in a highly decentralized way, around the whole world (and at every hour of the day, it seems to me). The two most active conversations, of course, are about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XULRunner investment<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and reactions to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris' provocative video<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Everyone I know involved with Mozilla has taken both of these conversations very seriously. I think we&rsquo;ve addressed much of the issue with XULRunner (at least the miscommunication issue, although there are clearly differences of opinion that can &amp; should be discussed more in online forums, in blogs, at Developer Days, etc). But the other issue, I think, not so much.</p>
<p>I believe there are two basic set of issues here: (1) the content &amp; the questions, and (2) the way the conversation is happening. This post is about the second set of issues: the way the conversation is happening.</p>
<p>First, here&rsquo;s what I know from my experience with Mozilla: everyone I know who&rsquo;s involved at any level, in any language, in any country, is extremely aware of the place Mozilla sits on the Web. Everyone is incredibly sensitive to what developers think about what&rsquo;s happening, what users think about what&rsquo;s happening, and what other voices on the web think about what&rsquo;s happening. And it&rsquo;s a very populist movement: everyone I know here wants the web to be open, uncontrolled &amp; free. For the moment that fight is in the browser window, but everybody knows that the edges are moving around.</p>
<p>So when prominent voices put up thoughts about direction, details, intent &ndash; most everyone pays attention. Everyone&rsquo;s first reaction is &ldquo;I wonder if I did something wrong here. Wonder what I need to fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tara <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posted yesterday<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that one of the first rules of responding to criticism is to try not to take it personally. Obviously a correct point of view, but here&rsquo;s the rub: Mozilla exists because everyone takes criticisms exceptionally personally, irrespective of whether they&rsquo;re fair or not, based on fact or not, reasonable or not.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll assert that that type of personal accountability &amp; reaction is what the world needs, actually. It&rsquo;s companies that don&rsquo;t take criticism personally. It&rsquo;s organizations. It&rsquo;s individuals who don&rsquo;t care. But that&rsquo;s not Mozilla. In the 2 years that I&rsquo;ve been here, I&rsquo;ve observed hundreds or thousands of people around the world who take it personally that the web&rsquo;s not open to everyone, that companies think it can be controlled. And it&rsquo;s caused a whole lot of people to do unnatural acts to remedy that. Working for days straight to get builds done. Flying halfway around the world to help someone start a community in Taipei or Beijing or Prague. Being available pretty much 24-7 on IRC/IM/forums/&hellip;</p>
<p>So in my view what&rsquo;s happened over the last week or so is a large set of frustrated, personal reaction to some assertions that were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->almost <!-- raw HTML omitted -->framed as questions. But the tone of accusation is getting in the way of the conversation.</p>
<p>For example, we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talk more about what&rsquo;s happening in cities around the world and what&rsquo;s happening on university campuses, because there&rsquo;s an incredible amount of activity. But the point was put this way: &ldquo;dump spreadfirefox; get your focus back. power to the people — not more centralization. where’s the college teams? run it like a presidential but stop asking for donations. events, mash pits… MozCamps… whatever… I know something is happening in Japan with Joi Ito… but that’s about all I know about.&rdquo; Stuff like this (and more, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->professors writing curriculum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on open source) is happening! The implication that&rsquo;s being made (explicitly) is that it isn&rsquo;t. Posing it differently: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening on campuses? In other countries?&rdquo; elicits a completely different response. It should make Mozilla folks reflect on what parts they thought were clearly communicated (but obviously aren&rsquo;t) and how to make that better.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, all I know is this: taking things personally is what motivates people to work harder, to make things better. Mozilla people all wear their hearts on their sleeves, and I think that&rsquo;s the engine for both being proud of where things are and wanting to become more.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Having said that, I&rsquo;d like to see if we can get moved past that, and focus on the content for a while. I can pick out some questions in Chris' post and others &ndash; questions like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Mozilla&rsquo;s position/response on Silverlight/Flash/Java FX?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What does Moz spend most of its time on now?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening internationally?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;What about XULRunner?&rdquo; Those are all good questions to be clearer on, help get better understanding of everyone&rsquo;s position on.</p>
<p>But there are a lot more. What are they?</p>

I&rsquo;ve enjoyed Pahlaniuk for several years, since I (finally) read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fight Club<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a while back. Pahlaniuk is a pretty fantastic writer &ndash; I find that when I read his books, I always feel different &ndash; there&rsquo;s a manic pacing that he seems to be unique in being able to create. Having said that, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fight Club<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a better book &ndash; this is probably the weakest of the several books of his I&rsquo;ve read (although the book jacket is fantastic). It feels gross in some places just to be gross (a Pahlaniuk special), other times the writing sparkles. Good to read, but not his best. (I also finished Jonathan Lethem&rsquo;s new book this weekend, also good, but a stark contrast in styles.)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot the last few days about the debate that&rsquo;s been going on about what &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; should do. [I put &ldquo;Mozilla&rdquo; in quotes here because it&rsquo;s a quite unusual &amp; difficult to understand thing &ndash; but the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->link to Mike&rsquo;s post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is maybe the best articulation I&rsquo;ve seen, especially when viewed through special, snark-reducing glasses. (I don&rsquo;t reduce the snark, personally &ndash; it&rsquo;s what I like about Mike&rsquo;s posts.)] Or, rather, what Mozilla should <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do more of<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do faster<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do better<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They&rsquo;re all right, of course. We should do more, faster, and do it better. The criticisms in the debate, both explicit &amp; implicit, tend to create a lot of introspection &amp; wider debate, which I think, ultimately is good, healthy and productive. Even debates like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the one on languages<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that pops up from time to time helps to clarify things.</p>
<p>Like Mike, I&rsquo;m having a tough time reconciling calls for centralized decision-making in something that&rsquo;s fundamentally decentralized. Even with Mozilla (Foundation + Corporation) making some decisions on where to put money or people to work, I believe we&rsquo;re still one of the most decentralized, global, egalitarian and successful technology/product organisms in the world. But more on that later&hellip;</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve been thinking about specifically this morning is the conversation about whether Mozilla (again, a loosely defined concept at best, but for the moment, let&rsquo;s assume that people mean Mozilla Corporation + Foundation) should focus on Firefox and whether we should focus on building a platform for application development. It&rsquo;s a bit of a false framing of the problem, though, and here&rsquo;s why: Firefox is, of course, an application that somewhere north of 100 million people in the world use to interact with the Internet. (and only around 50% of them use English language versions, which is a topic for another time.) But it also, today, is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 separate and distinct platforms<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for building applications on.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s XUL, of course, for building extensions &ndash; and at last count, there are around 2,500 extensions that have been written that we know about that run the gamut from trivial to shockingly useful. These extensions work in the browser, and (mostly) make your browsing experience more productive. There are a number of startups who have built these &ndash; several even using Firefox extensions as their initial or primary entry point. Some of the venture-backed (or angel-backed) ones that come immediately to mind are: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->del.icio.us<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StumbleUpon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FoxMarks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JetEye<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yoono<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AllPeers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FoxyTunes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ScribeFire<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AdaptiveBlue<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CoolIris<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; that&rsquo;s 10 quick ones, but there are many more that I&rsquo;ve forgotten or not ever known about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s a framework for building other applications that aren&rsquo;t within the browser &ndash; commonly called (and grouped together) as something called XULRunner (or, more precisely, a collection of things which includes XULRunner, Gecko, and more). We&rsquo;re a little loose in what we call XULRunner, but here I&rsquo;ll just lump together applications that are using XUL as a platform to build more things that aren&rsquo;t browser-based on top of it (I know this is broader than most people&rsquo;s definition). Using XULRunner (or the Mozilla codebase) to build standalone apps (or derivative browsers) is so far quite popular among startups and large enterprises alike. Some of the venture-funded endeavors here are backed by the most successful VCs on the planet, and a brief, non-exhaustive list, includes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joost<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Songbird<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, plus many more in stealth mode and behind corporate firewalls. And not to mention <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thunderbird<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an e-mail client used by 5M+ people, and projects like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Camino<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SeaMonkey<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Democracy Player<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, all of which are doing amazingly well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most importantly, it&rsquo;s the web. In no small measure, the explosion of high interactivity AJAX applications can thank Firefox&rsquo;s emergence in 2004, both in terms of a good platform to develop on (and getting better, with fantastic extensions like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firebug<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), and in terms of the pressure that it&rsquo;s put on Microsoft to put out a better, more standards-oriented browser and do real development on the web again. These applications are uncountable &ndash; thousands, or hundreds-of-thousands. Lots, anyway, and, as I said, resulting in 100M+ Firefox users, even before counting the positive impact on the 100s of millions of more IE users around the world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And while I&rsquo;m on the subject of the open web, in our web-focused community, we keep talking about it like the fight is won. Like the web is open forever, for everyone. But it isn&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t for, say, the 137M users in China, 99% of whom use IE-based browsers and are plagued by spyware &ndash; most who I talked with figure all the malicious software on their computers is just the price of being on the Internet. It isn&rsquo;t for folks whose langage is Thai or Kurdish or Vietnamese &ndash; or countless others &ndash; who don&rsquo;t yet have a browser that&rsquo;s in their own language. It isn&rsquo;t for Koreans, where the overwhelming force of government and industry has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->built a Windows-oriented monoculture<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And it isn&rsquo;t, really, even with content. Flash is doing fantastically, driven by successes of companies like YouTube. And there are 3 major, potentially industry-changing efforts (Microsoft&rsquo;s Silverlight, Adobe&rsquo;s Apollo, Sun&rsquo;s JavaFX) to build new platforms that use words like open, but are as proprietary as Java ever was for Sun, and probably more so. They&rsquo;re all awesome technologies, and awesome demos. But they&rsquo;re not the open web. They&rsquo;re built by a vendor, controlled by a vendor, tooled by a vendor. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe&rsquo;s putting up $100M<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; significantly more than the wherewithal of a project like Mozilla &ndash; to help companies take that first hit.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the most useful way to measure, but Mozilla has done this with fewer than 100 employees. We were fewer than half that a year ago, and more like 15 people total 2 years ago. This obviously and absolutely undercounts the whole of Mozilla &ndash; 25%+ code for Firefox was contributed by volunteers; all non-English localizations were; and clearly the debate which I mentioned is involving many, many people in our extended world.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a little summary. By my count, the absolute most conservative view is that 100 paid people are supporting more than a dozen funded startups building extensions for Firefox, more than a half dozen funded startups building completely new applications, countless web-based application startups, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more than a million users per employee<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. All for less money than Adobe is putting into Apollo&rsquo;s launch. Way less.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy high leverage. As much leverage as any organization I know of in the world.</p>
<p>Can Mozilla do more? Yes. Can it go faster? Yes. Can Mozilla continue to support a giant ecosystem of enterprises built on top of Moz technology? Absolutely. Can Mozilla do everything? Save the world? Absolutely not. And, to be honest, nobody is more critical of Mozilla than people in our community. Far from being frustrating, it&rsquo;s actually amazing. Enabling. And it&rsquo;s the reason that Mozilla (in the large, not in the Foundation + Corporation sense) keeps moving forward, keeps making things better.</p>
<p>We do have to make choices, though. There&rsquo;s only so much time, there&rsquo;s only so much attention. It&rsquo;s tough for a small band of folks to change the world, and sometimes you do things in an order you may not like the best.</p>
<p>But some days we&rsquo;re faced with real, explicit choices. Like whether to ship Firefox 3 this year. Or how much time to devote to making sure that those aforementioned Thais can finally get a browser that actually works in their native language. Or how to help users in Dalian, users in Osaka, users in Great Falls, users in Ankara &ndash; to help them understand that there are choices here, and that they can (and should) have more control over their web experience than they do. Or, as many have pointed out, to make XULrunner more complete so startups can do their legitimate work and change the world in their own ways.</p>
<p>These goals are all laudable. They&rsquo;re all important. They&rsquo;re all gigantic. So sometimes we make choices. Sometimes we go with the grain of the wood, so to speak, and try to spotlight great things that are happening in spite of any choices that &ldquo;we&rdquo; make.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this: the fact that this conversation is happening is a huge testament to the entire community &ndash; it means that Mozilla has relevance, that it&rsquo;s got an opportunity to continue to do amazing things. For a market that everyone, including me (well, everyone except the Mozilla community) thought was moribund just a few years ago, that&rsquo;s a special, maybe singular accomplishment. While there are real, contentious, meaty conversations happening about what &ldquo;Mozilla&rdquo; should do, we should all remember what an amazing set of things are happening already, and tomorrow, and the next day, too.</p>

I&rsquo;ve had this book around for 2 or 3 years &ndash; I kept reading a chapter or two, then putting it down. I finally got through it the past few weeks &ndash; it&rsquo;s an interesting book. It&rsquo;s all about our alphabet, and how it came to be the way it is, in terms of which letters are in our alphabet, how they look, and how they sound. After the introduction, there&rsquo;s a chapter for each letter &ndash; some are better than others, for sure. My favorite is on the letter &ldquo;E&rdquo; (always the glory hog, at least in English &ndash; see, there E goes again, starting that word) &ndash; and how it&rsquo;s derived from a semitic character that is itself derived from an earlier character that was effectively &ldquo;hey!&rdquo; &ndash; both in meaning &amp; pronunciation &ndash; and that the capital E letter shape itself is really from a person with both arms up yelling (rotate it counter-clockwise 90 degrees &ndash; teh end bars are the person&rsquo;s arms, the middle is the head). Funny.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking for a while about Silverlight, the new tools+browser plugin+platform stuff from Microsoft. it&rsquo;s very clearly designed to attack Adobe Flash as the rich media platform on the web (and the desktop). I can&rsquo;t help but think, though, that they&rsquo;re fighting the wrong war here.</p>
<p>Flash is very strong; there&rsquo;s no doubt of that &ndash; it&rsquo;s on something like 95% of the Internet-connected computers in the world &ndash; and the success of YouTube &amp; other video sites has really cemented its place on the Web. But it&rsquo;s not open or standard &ndash; it&rsquo;s owned by one company here on the left coast of the US &ndash; not such a different situation than Java was in a decade or so ago. And we all know how how that story played out (when&rsquo;s the last time you ran a Java applet? Don&rsquo;t know? Right.)</p>
<p>And so Microsoft looks around at what they&rsquo;ve got, and their Studio.Net tools are one of their absolute strongest franchises. Combine that with the new religion that they&rsquo;ve got about services (instead of software), and they start to think they need to build yet another proprietary platform to compete head on with Flash, but leveraging their tool set. They know ubiquity is important, so in their version of &ldquo;ubiquity&rdquo; they build for PC &amp; Mac, for IE, Firefox &amp; Safari. Which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->looks <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lot like ubiquitous, but it actually isn&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s telling.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the mistake I think they&rsquo;re making: they&rsquo;re gunning at Flash alone, with their own proprietary, closed stack &ndash; Mix07 hype notwithstanding, they&rsquo;re not going to get any real help from anyone outside of Redmond.</p>
<p>And so if they really believe that Flash is the #1 threat to them on the web (I mean, aside from those cute &amp; cuddly googlers in Mountain View), and if they really believe that services are the bulk of their future business, then <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they should line up with the open web. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Build tools that emit not some weird stuff for yet another balkanized browser plugin. (Ever tried Windows Media Player on a Mac?) But instead use their huge tools franchise to create apps for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Web, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->using standards like SVG &amp; Canvas &amp; DHTML &amp; Javascript.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, they&rsquo;re on the side of the web, on the side of a billion Internet users, on the side of everybody who&rsquo;s not Adobe. But I think they can&rsquo;t see it because of their history, even with a new guy at the helm.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s Adobe v Microsoft v the Web. I don&rsquo;t see how they can really win this one.</p>
<p>[As an aside, I think a ton of stuff that Adobe has done lately shows that they&rsquo;re thinking much further down this path than Microsoft is, and my hat&rsquo;s off to them for that.]</p>

			 <p>i&rsquo;m struck today, for like the millionth time, how much there is to learn, how much there is to practice, how much there is to improve. i realized some this afternoon that i&rsquo;ve been unintentionally communicating a bunch of emotions that i don&rsquo;t actually have &ndash; i&rsquo;ve been emoting very grouchy/grumpy, when that&rsquo;s not something i actually feel. as i&rsquo;ve mentioned a bunch of times, i feel that i&rsquo;m in a super-charmed part of my life, where everything feels great, including work, family and health. i remember having the same feeling at stanford in the spring of my last year &ndash; everything was lazy afternoons at Sunken Diamond eating a slushy. but i guess that&rsquo;s not what my external visage has been communicating to everyone here, so i need to work on that some.</p>

			 <p>i may have mentioned this before, but i&rsquo;m going to try pretty hard to start booting into Vista from time to time. i&rsquo;d like to understand what it feels like to use Vista, and i want to keep in touch with what things feel like on the Windows side. although i have to say that right now, i think Vista is still on the exotic side. most things don&rsquo;t work quite right, the visual effects are interesting, but mostly not productivity-oriented.</p>
<p>one small thing: i&rsquo;ve gotten my bluetooth mouse &amp; keyboard to work, but it wasn&rsquo;t enabled by default. or, rather, i had to go into properties for each one after i set them up &amp; let Vista know that i wanted my mouse to &ldquo;use mouse capabilities&rdquo;. sigh.</p>
<p>on the font stuff in my blog, the reason that it&rsquo;s showing as significantly more readable in Firefox is that there&rsquo;s a css setting called moz-opacity that&rsquo;s set to 40%, but that&rsquo;s not supported by Safari. matters less on Windows because the font backs up to be Lucida, instead of Futura, which is installed on Macs by default. need to figure out a different styling to make it work better on Safari, otherwise might need to go to dark text against a light background again.</p>

			 <p>i attended a city council meeting today for the first time &ndash; and spoke on behalf of something i&rsquo;m working on. it was a very strange experience, and a ton of thoughts come to mind.</p>
<p>first: wacky physical layout. the city council sits in chairs above everyone &ndash; chairs that i sit in when i&rsquo;m on the library board. i have to say that i don&rsquo;t like them either sitting in them or presenting to them. it&rsquo;s an uncomfortable formality that really highlights the difference between council &amp; the people. seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>the other thing that feels strange is that it&rsquo;s not really a conversation. it&rsquo;s a series of people talking. order matters. showing up matters. participating matters. but it&rsquo;s not really set up to have a reasonable dialog. the laws in california &ndash; in particular the brown act &ndash; are structured to make everything <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transparent <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->accountable, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but not to engender good group decision-making or collaboration. it&rsquo;s about mobilization, coordination, and getting the message across to a set of people who make the call. it isn&rsquo;t necessarily about finding good solutions to problems.</p>
<p>but that might be a fundamental misunderstanding on my part of what civic life is about. my experience tonight has highlighted for me that it&rsquo;s completely, wholly alien to my daily work life. it also highlights that as our family becomes more attached to this city and this place &ndash; as we endeavor to become <!-- raw HTML omitted -->citizens<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in all meanings &ndash; that i have a great deal to learn about how to be effective and productive.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i got involved with the Library Board in the first place, so i&rsquo;m glad to learn these lessons.</p>
<p>[i&rsquo;d write more about some of the specific issues involved tonight, except for 2 reasons: (1) i&rsquo;m a little unsure of my responsibilities under the brown act in terms of talking about positions &amp; such, and (2) it was a set of emotional talks given by people who have lived in Sunnyvale for a long time and who care very much about it, and giving my emotional reaction, while it&rsquo;d be therapeutic, would be counter-productive to over-emote in this blog. proof that i can learn. :-)]</p>
<p>update: i wrote all the above during the public discussion part of the meeting. once that was over, the council did their wrangling for a while, and that was actually fantastic &amp; pretty productive, although still weird for me.</p>

<p>Well, this was okay, but not great. Really 2 separate books: (1) a critique of American entrepreneurship and the protectionist things our government should (he says) do to review it, and (2) a bogeyman story of how Chinese entrepreneurs are going to eat everyone&rsquo;s lunch. Not my favorite book, and I think represents a bunch of FUD that isn&rsquo;t really warranted. But interesting to understand what I think is probably a typical American&rsquo;s point of view.</p>

			 <p>i have these moments periodically, when i&rsquo;m flipping between iTunes, Firefox, mail.app, NewsFire, Adium, etc, when i honestly can&rsquo;t remember what working was like before exceptionally fast laptops and Internet connections. i literally can&rsquo;t imagine doing the work that i do today, or living the life that i lead, without this stuff.</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d we do research before?</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d we schedule lunches?</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d we figure out how to get anywhere in a foreign city?</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d we keep up with what&rsquo;s happening in a 2 year old friend in Philadelphia&rsquo;s life? or his parents'?</p>
<p>i honestly can&rsquo;t remember. i think that in the years since i got to Stanford (1989, 2 weeks before Loma Prieta) that something incredibly fundamental has taken place. a shift that&rsquo;s impossible to get your head around. and it&rsquo;s touching absolutely everything.</p>
<p>now &amp; then i just have to pause and be amazed at it all.</p>

			 <p>i just replaced the disk in my mbp with a larger (but slower) one: now it&rsquo;s a 5400 rpm 160 GB disk, and i&rsquo;m a much happier guy. mostly the reason i did it is that i kept running out of space on my 100 GB disk &ndash; between VMs, media files when i travel, etc, it was just always full. i&rsquo;m going to try to dual (or triple) boot into Vista &amp; Ubuntu from time to time now &ndash; i&rsquo;d like to make sure that i&rsquo;m in touch with what life&rsquo;s like on those platforms. it&rsquo;s challenging, though &ndash; as much as i do on the web now, i&rsquo;ve changed the way i work enough over the last few years to rely on a lot of smallish OSX programs. but we&rsquo;ll see &ndash; more about that later, as the experiment progresses. (one aside: Firefox &amp; Thunderbird are both exceptional applications on Windows. they&rsquo;ve got a lot of work still on OSX, but on Windows, man, they&rsquo;re great.)</p>
<p>the other thing i did was to reinstall OSX from scratch, and life is much better. i was getting the beach ball a LOT before &ndash; now not so much. we&rsquo;ll see what happens over time, but reinstalling (even) OSX every 18 months probably has benefits.</p>

			 <p>kathy&rsquo;s got class tonight, so it was just sam &amp; me, spending time together, listening to a little music, eating a little pineapple for dessert.</p>
<p>and i got this feeling that i&rsquo;ve been having a lot lately, where i just enjoyed watching sam, interacting with him, sometimes explaining things to him, sometimes listening to him. and i guess i realized that &ldquo;dadness&rdquo; &ndash; the feeling of being a father, and feeling good about it and happy &ndash; it&rsquo;s one that sort of sneaks up on you. it&rsquo;s always been terrific since sam&rsquo;s been here (and even longer, since kathy &amp; i have been together, for sure), but there&rsquo;s something about this feeling that&rsquo;s just amazing, and it pops up during funny, often simple times.</p>
<p>even this morning, as sam woke up around 6 (what last week before DST was 5!) and so we came out in the dark, but spent time looking at the moon and mars and talking about the stars and sun &ndash; even bleary-eyed, pretty fantastic, and getting better each day.</p>
<p>happy post. :-)</p>

<p>I was editing a spreadsheet yesterday and accidentally shifted some of the text in the grid to be in the Futura typeface, and since then, I&rsquo;ve been sort of obsessed with the way the typeface looks. (Picture &amp; link are from Wikipedia.) I&rsquo;ve always really enjoyed learning about letter forms, and got to take a class with designer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chuck Bigelow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when I was at Stanford. The class was awesome. We learned a lot about letter systems, of course, but also about the politics of type (there&rsquo;s a lot there &ndash; more than one typographer was burned at the stake because of their typesetting).</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m pretty blown away by looking at type in Futura the last day or so. Hard to explain exactly, but there it is. It was created in the 20s, it&rsquo;s a geometric sans serif, and just has such a sturdy feel to it.</p>
<p>Random post for the day.</p>

			 <p>Doing a quick search of my blog, I seem to be sort of obsessed with Daylight Saving Time. With this post, 1% of my 400+ posts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are about DST<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Hmm. Anyway, I like time.</p>
<p>Apropos of that, we&rsquo;re going through a semi-bogus effort this weekend of moving clocks ahead 3 weeks earlier than normal. I like the extra daylight for sure, and spring forward weekend is traditionally one of my favorites of the year &ndash; but it feels very early this year. The theory is that it&rsquo;ll save energy because when people get home from work around 6 or 7 o&rsquo;clock, they&rsquo;ll use less energy because it&rsquo;ll still be light outside. What the theory discounts is that people use a lot of lights &amp; such when they get up in the morning and it&rsquo;s completely dark outside, also. Recent study of Australian efforts in 2000 (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) suggests there&rsquo;s no energy savings at all.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it&rsquo;s sort of like squeezing blood from a stone &ndash; no matter what we do, the days are just still a little shorter than we&rsquo;d like them to be.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;ll see how Sam does next week. You&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d really be psyched at the idea that he&rsquo;d sleep until 7:30a now, but it&rsquo;s sort of a bogus economy.</p>
<p>In any event, happy DST &ndash; let&rsquo;s see if it feels like spring has sprung this year.</p>

			 <p>we&rsquo;ve been grappling with data a lot lately at mozilla, trying to understand more and more about the world we&rsquo;re living in and building. i look at charts &amp; graphs about what&rsquo;s happening every single day. i&rsquo;m hearing that sentiment just about everywhere on the web lately.</p>

			 <p>well, some weeks are better than others, i&rsquo;d say. this has been a long week at work for a variety of reasons &ndash; i think we&rsquo;ve got a handle on things now, but it&rsquo;s taken some time.</p>
<p>but there was an interesting, if discouraging, event earlier this week that i&rsquo;ll describe here. i&rsquo;ve come to view our incredible language diversity as one of the most amazing parts of the mozilla experience. firefox 2, for example, is now available in 50 or more languages, including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all 11 official South African languages<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. the day we launched, it was available in 37 languages. compare that with microsoft&rsquo;s launch of IE7, which was in&hellip;let me check&hellip;oh, right: English. now they&rsquo;re available in more, but it took some time. we&rsquo;ve made wide availability in many languages a primary driver for our release schedule, and the implication we&rsquo;re making is clear: english-speaking users are not the most important users in the world, but are part of a much broader context.</p>
<p>(incidentally, i just looked at our dashboards for this week, and non-english language use continues to make huge gains &ndash; english is at 50% this week, down from about 65% of our users a year ago &ndash; within a few days from now, we&rsquo;ll have no single majority locale, happily.)</p>
<p>anyway, as many officially supported versions as we have (the South African versions aren&rsquo;t), there are many community-contributed builds in the world in a variety of different languages. one new one that&rsquo;s on our radar this week is a beta version of kurdish &ndash; spoken in the region called kurdistan, including kurdish populations in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->wikipedia link<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>for reasons you can read about in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wikipedia article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this has caused a stir on our message boards and e-mail lists &ndash; there are exceptionally strong feelings both for and against.</p>
<p>the reason that this is discouraging to me should be obvious: education, access &amp; understanding are major parts (maybe the only parts) of making our world a better place to live. whether or not your neighbor has these things shouldn&rsquo;t be bad (or even neutral) to you &ndash; it should be an imperative. it shouldn&rsquo;t be a negative to any one person that software exists (in whatever form) for someone else to use.</p>
<p>this has happened to us in other locales &ndash; around the world, clearly, language is a proxy for a host of other cultural (and political and military) battles.</p>
<p>but my view is that making software (and other) information and software available to people to use &amp; repurpose however makes sense to them is incredibly important, and getting more so, and i&rsquo;m proud to be part of an organization committed to it.</p>
<p>one of the folks here pointed out that this is the type of problem we want to have &ndash; in other words, the fact that it matters so intensely to people means that what mozilla is doing, and what&rsquo;s happening on the Internet, is deeply important. but they&rsquo;re problems nonetheless.</p>
<p>the world feels increasingly small to me. in the past 6 months or so, i&rsquo;ve been to china, japan and france to do work for mozilla, and am blown away by all the changes afoot.</p>
<p>in related news, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a neat thing. it&rsquo;s a site that started by taking interesting US startup/venture blogs and translating them into Chinese &ndash; now they&rsquo;re doing the same thing in reverse, to make it possible for english-speakers like me to read chinese articles about the startup world. completely amazing.</p>
<p>anyone remember what life was like just 10 years ago? the memory for me is fading fast.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was a fun day &ndash; between Mozilla &amp; Reactivity, there were dozens of news reports on the web &amp; elsewhere about things that I&rsquo;m either currently involved in or was involved in not too long ago. Reactivity was always a pretty low profile sort of place &ndash; the ethos was to put our heads down and get things done. Great to see that rewarded. Mozilla is the opposite &ndash; someone sneezes in our office, and it makes headlines on news.com. Interestingly, the ethos is the same: people here are mostly focused on working hard and doing good work on behalf of users.</p>
<p>But the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->best <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thing about yesterday, by far, was the huge number of co-workers, friends, and people in related companies who reached out to say congratulations to me, see how everyone was doing. One of the very best things about my 7 years at Reactivity was the giant number of smart people who I got to spend time with, work with, argue with, drink with. It was really great to talk with so many yesterday, and humbling that so many of them took time out of their busy days to connect.</p>
<p>Also, my friend Adam Nash wrote a blog post today about something I had forgotten &ndash; I&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->written elsewhere<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how we brainstormed the beginning of Reactivity together in Cupertino back in 1997, but I had forgotten that we used an old Mac of his as our mailserver, and his rather large color printer, named 800lb Color Gorilla in our office for a long time. Seems like a million years ago, and I guess it sorta was. Anyway, Adam wrote a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nice post on his blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today about it. His blog is more professional than mine is. :-)</p>

<p>But anyhoo. One of the things Matt points out is that Accel Partners, and Peter Fenton in particular, really stuck it out with Reactivity through some grim times. Peter supported us when it was clearly personally uncomfortable for him, and I&rsquo;m really happy for this outcome for him. VCs often get (much deserved) criticism for short term actions, but I always found Accel and Peter to be longer term thinkers than that, and supportive over the long haul. Pete&rsquo;s at Benchmark now, but remains one of my favorite VCs.</p>

			 <p>i seem to be talking a bunch about moving my blog over &ndash; and in fact, i think we&rsquo;ll move mine and kathy&rsquo;s over in the next few weeks. one of the things we&rsquo;re a little stumped on, though, is what to do about the kid. more specifically, we obviously post a ton of info and pictures about him for our friends and family &ndash; and when we write about him we usually use his name. but as he gets older, i guess we&rsquo;re getting a little more concerned about his privacy, and, more importantly, his safety.</p>
<p>some friends of ours just use their kids' names next to pictures in blogs. other friends of ours only refer to their kids by an alias, so that any potential lurkers won&rsquo;t be able to connect names to photos. we&rsquo;re not really sure what to do. on the one hand, better safe than sorry, even though it&rsquo;ll make the writing seem a little stilted. on the other hand, we live in a pretty hyper-connected time, and it&rsquo;s probably a losing battle ultimately, although he doesn&rsquo;t have his own myspace page yet, thankfully.</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t know. any opinions?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m doing a series of posts on our China trip &ndash; some that are particularly politically or partner sensitive are behind the MoCo firewall &ndash; but I want to repost anything that&rsquo;s not company or politically sensitive here to my personal blog. Here&rsquo;s my first re-post (with some slight edits from the original, mostly in terms of voice):</p>
<p>Chris, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &amp; I just got back from about 10 days in Beijing &amp; Shanghai, which we were visiting to sort out what Mozilla’s status is there, what our prospects for making a difference there are, and to start reaching out to folks who can help us there. It was a very interesting &amp; productive trip — lots and lots of thoughts that I’m going to try to do a series of blog posts here about. A lot of it I&rsquo;ll repost externally, as it might be interesting to our broader community as well.</p>
<p>So the first thing I’ll note is that China is a big place. 1.3B citizens, something like 100 cities with a population of over 1,000,000. Land area that’s very nearly equal to the United States. Something like 2,000 major universities. 137M Internet users, which ranks the country second after the United States.</p>
<p>But China also displays a remarkable unity, stemming from it’s government over the past 60 years, certainly. There is a single written language (Simplified Chinese, so called because Mao instituted a single, unified written language across many, many different spoken languages/dialects including Mandarin, Cantonese, etc, and in comparison to Traditional Chinese, still used in Taiwan) and a single time zone (Beijing Standard) across the whole country. And their approach to planning is pretty unbelievable, ranging from things like the Pudong (literally “new area” in Shanghai) that they’ve constructed from nothing over the past 10 years or so after moving out 100k+ former residents to things like their series of 5 year plans/themes. As an aside, it seems that they really do work and live by their 5 year plans — at one of the ministries that we visited, the guy actually mentioned that they were doing something because they were in the middle of the 11th 5 year plan (do the math). Pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Not to mention that the intent of the government there is also to have a single (very large) point of connection to the Internet, all going through a system that locals call “The Great Firewall of China” — a system that seems to block certain sites &amp; types of content. Our experience there was that the Wikipedia was always blocked, as was the Google cache, and slashdot was often blocked, seemingly dependent on content of particular pages. Our experience was short, and clearly impacted by the Taiwan earthquake in December, so it&rsquo;s not authoritative. (I’ll post some notes about their unusual Internet infrastructure later, too.)</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;With Chinese characteristics&rdquo; was a phrase that we heard a lot in China &ndash; as in, they&rsquo;re embracing Capitalism, but with Chinese characteristics, or, they&rsquo;re building an open source software industry, but with Chinese characteristics. Ultimately, it means that as a nation they&rsquo;re doing more things that the Western world has done for a while, but in a way that may appear Western, and use the same words to describe it, but ultimately is something different.</p>
<p>In Shanghai I was struck by the intense consumerism: there were Ferrari &amp; Mercedes dealers everywhere, there were legitimate high-end fashion stores on both the street and in 10-story shopping malls, and, of course, there was a Starbucks (with Chinese characteristics) on every corner.</p>
<p>The Starbucks stores were notable in that they sell basically the same set of stuff as everywhere else for food &amp; drink, have the same set of coffee mugs &amp; travel mugs (often manufactured in China for sale around the world), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and everything sells for essentially the same prices as they do here in the States. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A latte is 24 RMB (about $3). A travel mug is about $12. Presumably a Mercedes costs a lot, too, although I didn&rsquo;t check. (Fun fact: Audi A6s were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everywhere <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in both Beijing and Shanghai &ndash; actually they were A6 Saloons, or A6L (for long) &ndash; I understand that the A6L plants are primarily in China.</p>
<p>And every one we went to or walked by (a lot of them) was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->packed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Much more crowded than any I&rsquo;ve ever been to here in the US.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s somewhat emblematic of my experience in Shanghai &ndash; relative luxury items, priced at US prices, with extremely high demand. (There were plenty of fakes markets as well &ndash; which also had a lot of folks &ndash; but not as many as the legitimate vendors.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strange thing, though &ndash; I think twice before paying $3 or $4 for a cup of coffee (which doesn&rsquo;t keep me from doing it regrettably often), but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that salary ranges in China, even in the cities, are nowhere near what they are in Japan, the US or Europe. (There was a newspaper report while we were there that Guangzhou (I think), one of the major cities in the South with more than 5M people (which makes it bigger than Toronto, Philadelphia or San Francisco) just crossed $10,000 USD in annual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per capita <!-- raw HTML omitted -->income.)</p>
<p>It seems to me that this will inevitably drive wages higher (and thereby costs of doing business in China), which has been widely reported, with tech companies moving manufacturing to Southeast Asia for lower costs. But more than that, it seems to me that this is a major impediment for China to create what popular press is terming as the largest middle class in the world. If wages don&rsquo;t accelerate to catch up with prices, being middle class won&rsquo;t exactly mean what it does here. (Related obvious thought: being middle class here in the States isn&rsquo;t what it used to be either. Coffee at $3 or a tank of gas at $50 should illustrate that point quite well.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not generally a big mystery reader &ndash; not like my mom or grandmother, certainly, who devour the genre. But I was given this book for my birthday a few weeks ago, so took it on my trip to China so I&rsquo;d have something to read. Short version is that it&rsquo;s a very good book. Slightly longer version is that Pelecanos is a writer for my favorite TV show, &ldquo;The Wire,&rdquo; and this book really reads like an episode of The Wire watches. Great dialog; complex, intertwined story lines; a lot of open-ended threads. It got a little confusing in places, but that could have been my fault because of jet lag &amp; such. Anyway, Pelecanos has been writing for a long time, so if you&rsquo;re into Law &amp; Order type crime drama, you should check this one out.</p>

			 <p>okay, i&rsquo;ve decided to move from typepad to wordpress (hosted at dreamhost, which seems fantastic so far), and am making a few decisions. my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->experimental blog is here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the moment, but it&rsquo;ll change. (the hardest part so far seems to be finding a domain name. yikes.)</p>
<p>anyhoo, the thing i&rsquo;m wrestling with now is where to store pictures. kathy&rsquo;s put a ton of sam&rsquo;s pictures on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sam&rsquo;s typepad-hosted blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but that&rsquo;s part of the reason we&rsquo;re moving &ndash; their options are super-limited for how you display photos. part of me thinks we should just put everything on flickr or photobucket and link from the new dreamhost site &ndash; but part of me thinks we should host all our own stuff, as there&rsquo;s really no practical size limitation on dreamhost&rsquo;s plans, and then use gallery or some other photo sharing server software.</p>
<p>anyone have thoughts?</p>
<p>(incidentally, i&rsquo;m thinking that getting all our photo links moved over from typepad, and the photos as well, is going to be a big pain.)</p>

			 <p>Kathy &amp; I were sorta thinking of not watching 24 this year, after the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->horrendous <!-- raw HTML omitted -->season last year, but I&rsquo;m glad we stuck with it, because this season is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s not the same as it used to be &ndash; it&rsquo;s now basically Melrose Place, with nuclear weapons &ndash; but nonetheless, great television. Apparently, last year it was still in a state of transition. Anyhoo, now it&rsquo;s great, and has led me to the new theory that all shows on Fox eventually become versions of Melrose Place. This could be an important &amp; revolutionary new theory of television, so I&rsquo;ll be working on it some this weekend.</p>

			 <p>hour 3 of my flight to beijing with Gen &amp; Chris &ndash; should be an exciting week for Mozilla stuff and personally. will no doubt have a lot to say about my experiences this week &ndash; it&rsquo;s an exciting thing.</p>
<p>a couple of early, tv-related thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the first 2 episodes of the new season of 24 are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hilarious. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->once you decide it&rsquo;s just ridiculous, it&rsquo;s pretty fun to watch. jack is so smart &amp; tough. the white house is so dumb. i think this season might be the best so far. if anyone wants to chat more about it, open a socket to my screen and we can talk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>borat is not really an airplane friendly movie. in fact, pretty much the least airplane friendly thing since Oz. what a great film, though. that guy is just terrific.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see if 4 batteries is enough. i&rsquo;m betting it will be this time, but i&rsquo;m only about 1/2 a battery in, so we&rsquo;ll see&hellip;.</p>

			 <p>3 things i think now, a day after MacWorld:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Steve is as good at what he does as Tiger Woods is at golf. Best ever. Nobody else close. (Same goes for Jonathan Ive, I suspect.) In the keynote, everything was pitch perfect. He completely knew his audience. The reality distortion field was amazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The iphone is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->important<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but not revolutionary in impact. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand. I&rsquo;ll likely buy one and be happy about it. (Although the fact that it&rsquo;s a closed system is a bad misstep, I think. Same misstep Steve generally makes on 1.0 products, so it&rsquo;ll probably get fixed eventually. Also, it&rsquo;s not gonna run OS X. Maybe the kernel, maybe some UI bits &amp; pieces. But not OS X like anyone knows OS X.) I think that the iphone will change how people think phones should work, yes, and raise the bar on design. But it&rsquo;s too much money to have a massive impact, and I think they&rsquo;ll use flash memory capacities &amp; pricing to keep their margins &amp; price points healthy. I also have a sense, from the time I&rsquo;ve been spending on Mozilla stuff in Asia, that it&rsquo;s going to look like a quirky American device from that side of the ocean. It&rsquo;s not a global product <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at all. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ll probably line up to buy one, though. Good move for Cingular. Wonder how much they paid for the right. (As an aside, I&rsquo;m <em>really</em> interested in finding out how much the devices will actually cost to make. I&rsquo;m betting somewhere close to $1k.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh, and also, i suspect that it&rsquo;s a closed system for the moment because it&rsquo;s not really done as an OS. Kinda the same reason that all the demos were either in Steve&rsquo;s hands or under glass. I have the sense that it&rsquo;s a pretty long way from ready. I&rsquo;m betting on Thanksgiving.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>I don&rsquo;t know about their apple TV thingy. Works great if you only get your content by buying it through iTunes. I, um, acquire mine in a variety of different ways. Can&rsquo;t use it with the appleTV. Only marginally useful at the moment. But the UI is great. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ll get one when people figure out how to either (1) import more comprehensive stuff into iTunes so it can stream to the appleTV or (2) spoof an iTunes server to effect the same.</li>
</ol>
<p>and a bonus thought (since Kathy&rsquo;s out at class and I have a couple of minutes):</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty dispirited about the OS &amp; software message, which is this: maybe we&rsquo;ll do some more of that computer stuff sometime. Who knows. Nothing interesting to tell you about it, like if we&rsquo;re ever going to fix our blogging platform (.mac) or give you a spreadsheet that works in real time (excel on Rosetta is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->painful<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). You&rsquo;ll know about it sometime in the future, maybe, if we ever decide it&rsquo;s interesting enough to talk about. For now, shinier work over here to keep our attention on.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll see. Maybe they&rsquo;ll announce all the software stuff tomorrow. Maybe they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Also, didn&rsquo;t Apple used to make, um, what&rsquo;s that word&hellip;.oh, right: computers?? The only time anyone mentioned a computer was when Steve talked about taking it out of their name.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Like HCI books, lately for some reason I&rsquo;ve been reading more business books. Not totally sure why &ndash; I think maybe it&rsquo;s because I can get through a whole book in an afternoon, compared to, say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blood Meridian, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->which I&rsquo;m struggling through as bedtime reading (it&rsquo;s amazing, like most of McCarthy&rsquo;s work &ndash; just challenging). Anyway, I picked this one up because I saw it on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diego&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; he&rsquo;s had some recommendations lately that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed.</p>
<p>The premise of this book is that there are a couple of very distinct models for organizations: centralized (the spider) and wholly decentralized (the starfish). The authors (Stanford GSBers, but worth reading in spite of that&hellip;) use this analogy: cut off the head of a spider and the spider dies. Cut off an arm of a starfish, and you often end up with two starfish. Starts by exploring the Spanish conquests of the Incas &amp; Aztecs (spider organizations) and comparing them to the United States' mostly ineffectual campaign against the Apaches (a starfish organization). The Apaches were harder to fight against because decisions weren&rsquo;t made by any one person, but were made on what the US would have perceived as the edges &ndash; by medicine men who were empowered by their community. The strange thing (for the US, at any rate) was that whenever they killed any of these important people, more would spring up in their place. I thought it was interesting that the authors point to the US giving the Apaches cattle as something that ultimately led to the disintegration of their coherent society. (The implication here is that the sedentary nature of livestock &amp; farming necessitated the creation of societal structures which were more centralized and less flexible &ndash; spider-thinking, where there was only starfish-thinking previously.)</p>
<p>As someone who works on and thinks about one of the most successful starfish organizations in the software industry, there was a lot in this short book for me to consider. Mozilla&rsquo;s roots, of course, since the beginning have been more like a starfish than like a spider &ndash; but as we get more and more important to the world, there&rsquo;s a strong pressure to add spider-like process in places. I think that&rsquo;s natural and not at all bad &ndash; there are things that spiders can do more effectively than starfish &ndash; and, in truth, virtually every organization is somewhere on a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spectrum <!-- raw HTML omitted -->between starfish &amp; spider. The trick, I think, is in doing the right style in the right situations. This leads to some strange decisions. Like, for example, in a starfish-oriented software organization, it&rsquo;s exceedingly difficult to really know how many actual people use your software (very analogous to Alcoholics Anonymous not having any real sense of exactly how many members are in their organization). Sometimes with starfish, it&rsquo;s better to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->approximately right<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, than either precisely wrong, or, worse, precisely right in ways that impede your ability to succeed on your own starfishy terms.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re doing at Mozilla is in many ways unprecedented &ndash; a blending of starfish &amp; spider thinking on a scale that affects hundreds of millions of people every day (either directly through the use of Firefox or indirectly).  So I&rsquo;m happy to have material like this that&rsquo;s thought-provoking and useful to remind us that while things are newish, many others have done things that can serve as models.</p>
<p>I think this would be useful for anyone to read, whether you&rsquo;ve thought much about the topic or not. I&rsquo;ve said this many times to folks around here, but I really think that small, highly leveraged, highly decentralized organizations are the future &ndash; so in this respect Mozilla (and other starfish) can act as pathfinders.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s a beautiful book, of course. Tufte doesn&rsquo;t really do anything that&rsquo;s not incredibly well-designed and constructed. This is his 4th book on, um, information design, I suppose you&rsquo;d call it. Read it over the weekend, in a bit of a return to reading about my field (HCI) for a while. I&rsquo;ve not read much on design in a long time &ndash; I think I got sort of fatigued for a few years &ndash; but now have read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maeda<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Tufte, and a few other things in the space of just a few weeks. I&rsquo;ve got more queued up, including Moggridge&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->compendium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. One thing I learned this time around is that Tufte self-publishes all his books. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re perfect, I suppose, and why they&rsquo;re harder to get than books that go through what I&rsquo;d call more normal channels.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a good book. But feels a bit like a mishmash of greatest hits (could he put that map of Napoleon&rsquo;s trip in more books?) mixed together with a rant on how Powerpoint is killing all that&rsquo;s good in this world. His point in this book, more than any of his others, is that if you&rsquo;re careful, you should always be able to let <!-- raw HTML omitted -->evidence <!-- raw HTML omitted -->speak for itself. You don&rsquo;t need to market it. You don&rsquo;t need to spin it. Just present it in ways that are meaningful and you&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>Part of it, I suppose, is that I read about &amp; internalized the idea of sparklines a pretty long time ago. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the chapter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; very very worth reading. They&rsquo;re wonderful. Every designer I know has been looking for some practical use for them, which has proven elusive. Maybe here&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one that would work<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. (Although I wonder if there&rsquo;d be an effective way to get enough datapoints to be useful.)</p>
<p>His point about Powerpoint is that Powerpoint makes us dumb. That the structure of the software necessarily makes us reduce the amount of meaningful information that we&rsquo;re presenting, and ultimately make arguments which, without evidence, aren&rsquo;t compelling. Both absolutely correct and beside the point, of course. This essay has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->critiqued elsewhere<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so I&rsquo;ll not do that again (although I very rarely voice quite the same opinion as Don Norman), but i will say that the whole chapter &ndash; maybe 1/4 of the book was devoted to it &ndash; felt deeply out of place and not very relevant to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, like a lot of expensive design books, this one is probably better for borrowing than for owning. Tufte has said there&rsquo;ll be a 5th book in the series &ndash; if history is an indicator, we should expect it in 2013 &ndash; so hopefully it&rsquo;ll be a great finish to an important series, and everyone won&rsquo;t worry too much about this one.</p>

<p>Bleak.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the word for this book. It&rsquo;s a post-apocalypse story of a man and his child &ndash; they&rsquo;re running away from the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; &ndash; all along the road &ndash; a desolate, barren, path through a worn out world &ndash; the road itself is the third character of the book. (None of the characters have names, interestingly.)</p>
<p>This guy is an absolutely incredible author. McCarthy&rsquo;s prose is magic. He&rsquo;s among the most forceful authors I&rsquo;ve ever read, and there&rsquo;s just no softness or give in his language. I won&rsquo;t go so far as to say he&rsquo;s the &ldquo;best&rdquo; or my &ldquo;favorite&rdquo;, in the sense that the world is just too big and styles of writing are so diverse &ndash; I like Murakami for some things, Vonnegut for some, David McCullough for others. I will say that McCarthy is one of the most muscular, most talented writers that I&rsquo;ve ever read, and I want to read everything he&rsquo;s ever penned. Not all at once, as it feels a little like watching back-to-back seasons of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wire <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(great, great show &ndash; the single-best on television) but not incredibly optimistic, and a little brutal emotionally to watch).</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t exactly a fun book to read, but is incredibly compelling. Hard to describe, but 100% worth reading.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->update: in thinking more about this, the story of the commitment between the man &amp; his boy is incredibly poignant and beautiful. it&rsquo;s the singular ray of hope in the book. it&rsquo;s really a beautiful, beautiful piece.</p>

<p>Adjusting to Tokyo time a little bit now &ndash; was able to sleep until 5a this morning. Went to the gym, but sorta crappy &ndash; short workout. But now I&rsquo;m at the point where I can make my own way in the morning, get my coffee from one of 3 or 4 different coffee shops, and get to the Mozilla Japan office on my own. It&rsquo;s amazing how much a little bit of recognition and autonomy helps in terms of feeling more comfortable in a foreign environment. I am finding that between iTunes video and my new Nano that I&rsquo;m more insulated from the local environment than I would have been in years past &ndash; but I&rsquo;m also more in touch with my family and more comfortable, so I&rsquo;m sometimes in a better frame of mind. Interesting tradeoffs. (The picture is a baseball stadium next to where our press conference was &ndash; there was a college tournament going on at the time &ndash; you could hear the drums from the outside.)</p>

			 <p>headed to tokyo now &ndash; about an hour into an 11 hour flight. we were a little late getting into the air, but shouldn&rsquo;t be too late getting in. the way this particular flight works is that it leaves at about 12:30p PDT Sunday (or any day) and gets in to Tokyo at 3:45p JDT Monday (next day). [coming home is sorta freaky &ndash; leaves Tokyo at 5:15p on Friday; gets back to San Jose at 10a that same day. :-)]</p>
<p>this has been a really convenient flight for me this year &ndash; this is the 4th time i&rsquo;ve taken it &ndash; makes getting to &amp; from Tokyo as easy as possible. i think i&rsquo;m getting the hang of things &ndash; when i get to Narita, it&rsquo;s a pretty quick walk downstairs to get onto the Narita Express into town (about an hour, give or take), then a couple of subway trains to get to akasaka-mitsuke station, which is right near my hotel. then a quick shower before heading to dinner with gen &amp; kaori, the two people in our Mozilla Japan office who i work with the most.</p>
<p>will be out for the week &ndash; helping out with the Firefox 2 launch &ndash; it&rsquo;s a really great product, i think. should be a fun &amp; eventful trip, as always. gen &amp; takita-san &amp; kaori always have things so organized &amp; well thought out that it&rsquo;s a breeze.</p>
<p>trying out my new ipod nano on the trip &ndash; the form factor is really terrific. Anyway, more from Tokyo soon.</p>

			 <p>&hellip;Steve Ballmer? WTF?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what he said in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BusinessWeek interview<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (italics are my own):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>[You&rsquo;ve got to ask] could Google do whatever it is they&rsquo;re hoping to buy without paying $1.6 billion? Is YouTube really some permanent, long-term thing, or is it a fashion? I&rsquo;m not saying it is a fashion. But every time we do valuations, I wonder if we can afford to keep this hot for 10 years. I&rsquo;m sure somebody at Google has got to do the same analysis, because even $1.6 billion is more than 1% of their market cap.</p>
<p>Is there a business model? Right now, there&rsquo;s no business model for YouTube that would justify $1.6 billion. And what about the rights holders? At the end of the day, a lot of the content that&rsquo;s up there is owned by somebody else.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The truth is what Google is doing now is transferring the wealth out of the hands of rights holders into Google<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So media companies around the world are all threatened by Google. Why? Because basically Google is telling you how much of your ad revenue you get to keep.They better get some competition. Us. Yahoo! (YHOO). Somebody better break through or you can short all media stocks right now. As long as there are two, you can hold onto media stocks. Google understands that. And that&rsquo;s one reason why they&rsquo;re willing to lose money up front. Just look at some of these deals. That MySpace deal (where Google provides the ad engine for MySpace). We bid a lot of money on that MySpace deal. And we got outbid. We wanted to win that MySpace (NWS) deal. At some point, we said we can&rsquo;t do this. Now Google can afford to spend more than us and Yahoo because they have more people in their ad system, so they&rsquo;re getting better yield, effectively.</p>
<p>Getting back to the core question, it all depends on how that plays out. I am surprised that Google would pay $1.6 billion for it.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Something&rsquo;s gone wacky when I find myself nodding my head through an interview of his.</p>

			 <p>Google paid $1.65B yesterday for YouTube. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it a bunch since then; starting to get stronger feelings about it.</p>
<p>First, I think that YouTube cashed out by flagrantly ignoring the rights of copyright holders, of the people who own the content that gets spread around. They used safe harbor laws to play within the letter of the law, but it was clear in a number of ways that they were never really doing much more than paying lip service. In my view, it&rsquo;s wrong to build a business that does that, and cashing out is pretty undeserved. (Although, I will say that they executed like crazy. That&rsquo;s a testament to them. A year and a half ago there were at least 50 &ldquo;flickrs for video&rdquo;. But they won.)</p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;m glad that video is becoming more viable on the web. It&rsquo;s changed the way that I think about the web in the last year for sure. VideoEgg has let us put up lots fo videos of Sam which have really made a difference with his relationship with his grandparents &amp; friends. iChat AV does the same thing. And the Democracy Player from Participatory Culture Foundation is a brilliant piece of work towards making video distribution truly more attainable by everyone.</p>
<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;m pretty surprised Google made this purchase. I know their stock value makes stuff like this relatively inexpensive for them, but, truly, they haven&rsquo;t been hammering away at Google Video for that long now. To cede the victory to YouTube after just a bit of time in the saddle doesn&rsquo;t imply, to me, much faith in their ability to execute in this non-search market.</p>
<p>Anyway, I can&rsquo;t get the development here out of my head for some reason &ndash; it&rsquo;s really got me noodling. Can&rsquo;t tell you why, exactly, except that it bothers me a bit.</p>

			 <p>Some of you know this already, but I&rsquo;ve been at Mozilla a bit more than 14 months now, and it&rsquo;s one of the most unusual, interesting, fascinating places that I&rsquo;ve ever worked. (And this is saying quite a lot, as other places I&rsquo;ve worked include Apple (crazy in a living-in-the-future sort of way), the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Superconducting Super Collider<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (crazy in a giant-hole-in-the-ground kind of way), and Trilogy (crazy Vegas-style).) It&rsquo;s been a really fun year, and I feel like I&rsquo;ve both learned a lot and contributed a lot.</p>
<p>Last week, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I shifted jobs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; from VP Business Development to COO (and I&rsquo;m joining the board as well). What this means is that I&rsquo;ll take broader responsibility at Mozilla in terms of helping us grow (we&rsquo;ve grown from about 20 people a year ago to about 70 now) and execute more efficiently and communicate better, both inside MoCo and outside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited about Mozilla &amp; what we&rsquo;re all doing here. The team is really terrific &amp; incredibly committed; current &amp; upcoming products are great; and it looks like we&rsquo;ve got lots and lots of different opportunities to contribute to the Internet on a global scale.</p>

<p>Kathy &amp; I watched one of our very favorite movies this weekend, for maybe the third for fourth time: Big Night. Fantastic, fantastic movie about 2 Italian brothers who come to the States to build a restaurant. It&rsquo;s not a movie with a ton of action, but what a wonderful, beautifully written, filmed, acted &amp; directed movie. The performance by Stanley Tucci is one of my favorites in any movie. I was introduced to this movie by my friend Al about a million years ago, and just love it. It&rsquo;s one of those where if you&rsquo;ve got the time and can notice the details, it doesn&rsquo;t really get any better.</p>
<p>also in the Big category: season finale of Big Love this weekend. good work. watching the Sopranos finale tonight if I don&rsquo;t fall asleep at 9:30 again.</p>

			 <p>lately i&rsquo;ve been going through an interesting work transformation. since january, i&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time with Mozilla Japan, working on our adoption there, and recently i&rsquo;ve been spending time with Mozilla Europe in France being sort of blown away by our traction in Europe, not to mention bits &amp; pieces of work in Taiwan, Canada, Russia, Germany and others. (although i&rsquo;ve not been to the last few places lately.)</p>
<p>so on any given day i&rsquo;ll generally IM with Gen in Tokyo, communicate with folks in Paris, and work on issues related to a few other countries.  (not to mention that virtually our whole Mozilla team is in Amsterdam for XTech just now.)</p>
<p>it sort of blows me away, to be honest &ndash; i feel really lucky to be doing this sort of work. it&rsquo;s exposing to a much larger set of issues than i&rsquo;ve ever been exposed to, and i&rsquo;m learning a lot quickly.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also amazing to me that such a small company (only about 50 employees &ndash; maybe 60 if you add in MozJP &amp; MozEU) has a gigantic global reach and things happening in nearly every corner of the globe.</p>

			 <p>This industry get-together about AJAX that I&rsquo;m attending is almost completely male. Not a huge surprise, I suppose, but out of 40-50 people in the room, there are exactly 2 women. 4% seems even lower than normal. This shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise to anyone, really, but just another reminder that our education system is a bit screwed up in this regard. Other problems exist as well (software executive ranks are almost exclusively male; venture capitalists are almost all male), but our education system is, I think, where we need to continue to focus on fixing the problem.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m at an industry meeting today about AJAX &ndash; basically the collection of technologies on the client and the server (but generally thought of mostly as DHTML &amp; Javascript) that most web companies are building out richer applications mostly delivered via web browser. Google&rsquo;s GMail started this trend in earnest (you can quibble here), but today there&rsquo;s a ton of interactivity in web applications that just wasn&rsquo;t there a year or two ago. Mozilla generally and Firefox specifically have had a big impact here, as the development (and especially debugging) experience on Firefox for AJAX-style applications is significantly better than with any other browser, at least for the moment.</p>
<p>Anyway. The first thing I&rsquo;ll say is that we&rsquo;re in this awesome building pretty close to where the Giants play in San Francisco &ndash; used to be the Macromedia building but is now, of course, the Adobe building. It&rsquo;s really a terrific building: old brick, exposed timbers &amp; beams &ndash; pretty much vintage SF Web 1.0 Bubble. :-)  <em><strong>But</strong></em> there&rsquo;s no friggin' open wireless network. What the heck? Are we back in 2004 or something? Ugh. So.</p>
<p>But what I really wanted to post about in this particular missive is how much things have changed, truly, and how much technology, for all its foibles, is incredibly more user-centered than it was when I was at Stanford, or Trilogy, or even Apple, really. Back in 1990, Mitch Kapor wrote something called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Software Design Manifesto <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I&rsquo;ll link to the article sometime when I can connect). What he basically asserted is that the software industry (which had just witnessed the release of Windows 3.0 &ndash; craptastic!! Now, improved with LanMan!) needed a new role that was analogous to a building architect (or urban planner, some others posited) &ndash; someone to think about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->human use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of software products. This was an important thought, and his essay was the first one that I read when I embarked on my work in HCI.</p>
<p>[Hmm. Gartner guy just noted an issue with Firefox 1.5.0.2 displaying GMail. Uh oh. Everyone in the room swiveled their heads to look at me. Hi, I&rsquo;m the Firefox guy. In the orange shirt. Hard to miss.]</p>
<p>[Aside: this talk is veering pretty wildly back &amp; forth between enterprise &amp; consumer applications, and can I just say this: Oh my god. Enterprise is sleep inducing. I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve spent half my career to date working on enterprise. Thank goodness for the other half &ndash; the consumer half. I&rsquo;m glad that I understand how to operate in both worlds, but man. Yawn.]</p>
<p>Anyway, even 5 years after Mitch wrote that essay, when I went to Trilogy, HCI was considered a slightly wacky discipline. I managed to convince Joe (our CEO) that HCI mattered for Trilogy. (Probably true. Hard to say. Long, but boring story, as the aside above suggests.) I spent time working on it at Apple. And occasionally companies would hire us to help them with it at Reactivity. But it was always a bit of a hard sell, and I think most people viewed it as a discipline that was somehow separate from the technology or business activities that companies were working on.</p>
<p>Now, though, it&rsquo;s different. With both consumer and enterprise software, it seems to me that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everyone <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talks about the user experience, about how getting it right is crucial to application adoption, and application adoption is the thing that matters, either in getting a return on your investment in the enterprise or in getting consumers to use your service. It&rsquo;s an interesting, and fundamental shift, seems to me. We&rsquo;re getting to the point now where technology is still a little wonky, but at least the conversations mostly include at least putative normal human beings and ideas about how they&rsquo;re going to use our work. That&rsquo;s a great step forward.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s more fundamental than that. In my admittedly mostly homogenous circle of friends (nerds, all of us), the things that people get most excited about anymore are things like videos of Stephen Colbert online or experiences like World of Warcraft or open media like political bloggers or just places to interact like MySpace or Facebook. The technology matters &ndash; is critical, in fact &ndash; but it&rsquo;s less often <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the point <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of what people are working on. And HCI seems to me to be blending into the fabric of the development &amp; business teams instead of standing as a separate discipline (this is a super-long conversation and it&rsquo;s more complicated than what I just wrote, but the gist is true.).</p>
<p>[Another side note: most startup guys that I talk with lately have MacBooks &ndash; it&rsquo;s sort of the uniform of the moment here. But in this room, it&rsquo;s probably more like 60% Windows machines and only 40% MacBooks. I think it&rsquo;s maybe because a lot of these folks are in enterprise environments.]</p>

			 <p>Nearly every Monday when I come in to work (or Tuesdays after a long weekend, like this one), someone asks how my weekend was.  And lately, I nearly always answer something like: &ldquo;Fantastic.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;re doing very much these days &ndash; in fact, we&rsquo;re decidedly sedentary in our lifestyle most weekends lately. This weekend was mostly about lying around on the living room floor, tickling Sam, helping him grab stuff, taking his hands off my glasses or out of Kathy&rsquo;s hair, and cleaning up the occassional baby hurl from the carpet. Oh, and watching Stanford basketball underperform. (sigh)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And yet, I find myself thinking a lot about something I wrote in my blog a while back &ndash; Kurt Vonnegut saying &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->If this isn&rsquo;t nice, what is?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; I went back and re-read that post today, and recalled that what I was referring to in my post was that my friend Bryan was getting great news about his health and Kathy &amp; I had just found out that baby Sam was on the way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, I&rsquo;ll say it again: if this isn&rsquo;t nice, what is?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>This one was really, really worth it, though. Sweet, melancholy movie &ndash; Zach Braff is terrific, of course, but Natalie Portman is just exceptional. Probably the best I&rsquo;ve ever seen her. Music was great; story was great.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the behavior change is that there&rsquo;s some relatively important flow of news that I like to have delivered directly to me, but not to my mail inbox (I think of my mail in box quite distinctly as a list of action items). There is a whole category of news that I don&rsquo;t want delivered like this flow &ndash; CNN, ESPN, things like that &ndash; news that has a much larger set of items and a relatively small list of items that I care about. Firefox is still clearly the best way to get that news.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m currently in Pasadena for the day &ndash; making this my first business trip for Mozilla, my first work-related trip in nearly a year, and only the 3rd airplane that I&rsquo;ve been on in total this year. I have to say that not traveling has been awesome &ndash; it&rsquo;s been great for my time with Kathy, my diet, my health, and my mental state. Getting on a plane today was nice, though &ndash; nice to get a bit of totally disconnected time in the air, nice to drive around Pasadena and look at things I haven&rsquo;t seen before. I don&rsquo;t really ever want to go back to the travel schedule that I had last year &ndash; was just too much. Also, I&rsquo;m struck by how much &ldquo;in between&rdquo; time there is &ndash; time waiting for a meeting, or when you&rsquo;ve just boarded the plane, or whatever &ndash; that&rsquo;s time that I get to listen to my iPod, or read my book, or things like that. Kathy &amp; I haven&rsquo;t had much of that lately, with Samosaurus around. Kind of neat once in a while.</p>

<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway, now it&rsquo;s 11a; we&rsquo;ve been here about 45 minutes, and the nurses
aren&rsquo;t quite clear on whether her water&rsquo;s broken. We&rsquo;re pretty clear,
but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to count. :-)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>11:20a now, and I think they&rsquo;re about to send us home, but are going to
call the doc first. This all seems very sketchy to me. Basically, they
test the pH to see if the water&rsquo;s broken, using that litmus paper that
we all used back in high school science. It came back as inconclusive.
Seems like we should know somewhat more definitively what&rsquo;s going on,
but maybe not.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>12:55p and we&rsquo;re still here, but haven&rsquo;t talked with the doctor yet.
Seems like Kathy&rsquo;s feeling contractions maybe every 20 minutes now, and
we think her water&rsquo;s definintely broken, but, again, don&rsquo;t have
confirmation on it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now it&rsquo;s 3:30p, and the kid is definitely on the way. We&rsquo;ve been
admitted, seen the doc, and, hey!, Kathy was right. Labor. Contractions
are every 5 minutes or so now. Kathy&rsquo;s hooked up to an IV for
hydration, and the techs are taking some of her blood now. Dr. Hoff
says things look very good; baby&rsquo;s heart rate is doing very well, and
everything is fine. We&rsquo;re watching <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Princess
Bride<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on DVD now &ndash; one of Kathy&rsquo;s favorite movies, and she&rsquo;s
in pretty good spirits. &ldquo;Anybody want a peanut?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Almost 8p now &ndash; time seems to be moving pretty quickly. Kathy got her
epidural about 45 minutes ago, and life has been a lot better since
then. Around 5p the contractions got to be super-painful &ndash; she was
having a really tough time. It&rsquo;s still early going yet &ndash; she was about
2 cm dilated (on the way to 10 cm, for folks who haven&rsquo;t gone through
this) &ndash; but contractions are happening every 3 minutes very regularly,
and everything is good. Beth came by a bit ago and was here for all the
pain/epidural excitement, plus she brought me a sandwich. Really nice
to have her here. Now she&rsquo;s out getting dinner, Kathy&rsquo;s asleep (yay!)
and I&rsquo;m watching the American League beat the bejeesus out of the
National League in the All Star Game, plus listening to some Amos Lee
on my iPod. I&rsquo;m glad Kathy&rsquo;s getting a little sleep &ndash; it was hard to
watch her go through the painful bits a while ago. It&rsquo;s really nice
thinking about all of our family going to bed tonight thinking about
the new little guy who&rsquo;ll be here tomorrow. Clarity is coming in fits
&amp; starts for me. Every once in a while I get glimpses of us as a
family, or me as a dad, or Kathy as a mom. It&rsquo;s hard to put words to
it, really. But it&rsquo;s a special feeling, I know. It&rsquo;s a weird thing to
explain &ndash; there&rsquo;s a certain feeling of communion knowing that this
feeling of becoming a parent is something that so many other people
have felt &ndash; a type of humility and shared experience, I think. I
suspect I&rsquo;ll have a lot of these moments over the coming hours, days,
months &amp; years. Anyway, just now I&rsquo;m happy that Kathy&rsquo;s getting a
bit of respite.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Getting close to midnight &ndash; after sleeping for about an hour, Kathy
&amp; I watched an episode of Scrubs, then one of the Muppet Show &ndash;
the awesome episode when Steve Martin guest starred. What a great show.
Fun to think that we&rsquo;ll get to experience all of these things that we
love like the Muppets with our boy. Kathy&rsquo;s going back to sleep now,
but I&rsquo;m not too tired, so I&rsquo;m going to watch some stuff on my laptop
then maybe get some sleep myself. We&rsquo;re thinking that it&rsquo;ll probably be
4a or so when the real action starts &ndash; maybe looking at a 5a birth?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>4a now, July 13th. Birthday, looks like. Happily, Kathy&rsquo;s pretty much
asleep now, and has gotten a few hours since midnight as well. I
stepped out of the room for a bit, because as long as I was there, the
two of us wanted to chat, which means not being asleep. :-) Anyway, I&rsquo;m
in a small waiting room down the hall for a bit while she sleeps. The
hospital is really empty tonight &ndash; just nothing going on. We think
there&rsquo;s another woman in very early labor across the hall from us, and
a co-worker of Beth&rsquo;s who had a baby girl about 12 hours ago, but
that&rsquo;s it. In the rest of the hospital, everything is pretty much
silent, even the ER. I just stepped outside a little bit for some fresh
air and it helped a lot &ndash; you forget that you&rsquo;ve been inside for a
long time breathing inside air. One of the things that I really love
about the Bay Area is what nighttime air feels and smells like &ndash; crisp
&amp; cold, no matter what time of year. A little after midnight we had
a bit of a scary episode: the baby&rsquo;s heart rate declined to about 80 or
90 beats per minute, after being pretty much at 150 all day. We think
it got worse when they had Kathy turn onto her right side &ndash; during the
pregnancy, the little guy has pretty well burrowed into her right ribs.
They turned her back onto her left side and everything has been good
since. Speculation is that maybe the umbilical cord is in a funny
position &ndash; that may mean Dr. Hoff has to be a little creative during
delivery, but we&rsquo;ll see. I did have my first truly parental feeling, I
think &ndash; I felt just for a minute that there was maybe something really
wrong with my boy and I couldn&rsquo;t do a single thing to help him. Stomach
clenched &ndash; just a terrifying, helpless feeling. I suppose I&rsquo;ll feel
like that more often from now on. That seems okay to me. :-) Anyway,
the baby was never in serious distress; things seem to be fine now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>7:10a, things going fine. Kathy&rsquo;s at 7 cm, so could be awhile still.
We&rsquo;ve been here 21 hours now, so a good long time, but she&rsquo;s doing just
great. She&rsquo;s starting to feel some discomfort in her ribs with each
contraction now, but not a lot else to report. It feels different here
in the morning &ndash; new day, new things to happen. On the news they&rsquo;re
talking mostly about the space shuttle Discovery going back into space
after the time off because of the accident. 34 years ago, when Kathy
&amp; I were born, we had only recently gotten to the moon &ndash; I wonder
what space exploration, and other science, will be like 34 years from
now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>12:30p now, and Kathy&rsquo;s resting &ndash; she&rsquo;s almost completely dilated,
which means it&rsquo;s nearly time to push, which we figure will take an hour
or so, depending on how things go. It&rsquo;s taken a little bit longer than
we expected, with some adventures with her epidural getting
disconnected, but things are doing well now, the baby&rsquo;s heartbeat is
strong, and he&rsquo;s nearly here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>12:40p. In the few minutes before all the action, it&rsquo;s pretty quiet in
here &ndash; nothing but the steady beat of our boy&rsquo;s heart. I like watching
Kathy sleep now, getting a bit of extra energy in. I&rsquo;m so proud of her
through this whole pregnancy &ndash; she&rsquo;s just been incredibly strong,
graceful, responsible &ndash; through a lot of weird, uncomfortable
situations. People we&rsquo;ve seen over the last few weeks couldn&rsquo;t believe
that she was so close to due &ndash; she&rsquo;s just been incredibly positive and
energetic and happy. I&rsquo;m really proud of her. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>12:50p. Somehow, I&rsquo;m really proud of our boy, too. I don&rsquo;t know how
that can be, since we haven&rsquo;t really laid eyes on him yet, and he
hasn&rsquo;t done much more than kicking Kathy in the ribs a bunch of times
over a lot of months. It&rsquo;s weird &ndash; listening to his strong little
heartbeat, I feel proud of him for just hanging in there. I think he
knows the jig is up now, though &ndash; he knows something&rsquo;s happening to
the warm, comfortable spot his mom has kept for him over the last 9
months. Starting to move around a bunch, time to head out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>now it&rsquo;s 10p on July 13, 2005 &ndash; and Samuel Pearce Lilly is getting
towards 7 hours old now. he&rsquo;s sleeping soundly; kathy and <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>i are listening to music and watching him sleep. amazing. perfect,
really. here&rsquo;s a bit from a simon &amp; garfunkel song that just played
that seems appropriate: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>    &hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    my mind&rsquo;s distracted and diffuse<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    my thoughts are many miles away<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    they lie with you when you&rsquo;re asleep    <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    and kiss you when you start your day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>    &hellip;    <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    and so you see i have come to doubt<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    all that i once held as true<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    i stand alone without beliefs <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    the only truth i know is you.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>    and as i watch the drops of rain<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    leave their weary paths and die.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    i know that i am like the rain &ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>    there but for the grace of you go i.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>know what that song&rsquo;s called? &ldquo;kathy&rsquo;s song&rdquo;. always been one of my
favorites. anyway, after a lot of amazing effort by kathy, Sam was born
at 3:20p this afernoon. 8 lbs 1 oz, shattering the over under &ndash; we
were thinking more like 7 pounds. 19 inches tall. and super healthy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>been a busy day for us &ndash; we spent a little time with the little guy,
then i went with him to get a quick checkup and bath. since kathy&rsquo;s
water had been broken for more than 18 hours, they wanted to do a blood
test on him &ndash; everything came back great. he&rsquo;s been mostly sleeping
super peacefully for the last 4 hours or so &ndash; it&rsquo;s fun to just watch
him. so many expressions he&rsquo;s already got that we&rsquo;ve never seen.
anyway, that&rsquo;s it for now. more late tonight, probably. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited about the opportunity &ndash; there&rsquo;s a ton of interesting stuff happening on the web these days, and the Firefox folks are right at the center.

<p>Saw an interesting movie last night: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->March of the Penguins.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Pretty amazing documentary done by a French crew (and narrated by Morgan Freeman) about a year in the life of emperor penguins in Antarctica. Completely amazing story about slightly strange birds living, mating &amp; reproducing in the harshest area on the planet. Incredibly anthropomorphic, the film was fun to watch &ndash; we&rsquo;d recommend it to anyone. Great for all ages, too &ndash; we were thinking about taking our nephew &amp; nieces.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>36 amazing words written by a 33-year old Thomas Jefferson in Philadelphia 229 years ago. As perfect a statement of human rights as has ever been penned. Even with all the turmoil in the world and domestically, I still get shivers when I read the Declaration of Independence and think about what a revolution it started. Here&rsquo;s some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more information<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about it.</p>
<p>13 years after the Declaration was signed and war with Britain was declared, we ratified the Constitution, largely architected by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison (Jefferson&rsquo;s Virginia protege). Here&rsquo;s a bit from the preamble (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Schoolhouse Rock<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fans can hum along or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->listen here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->):</p>
<p>&ldquo;We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and sure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Different, huh? Much more focused on what they&rsquo;re trying to achieve, and how to make it work. The history books often elide the two events, making the Constitution seem like an inevitable follow-on piece of work to the Declaration, but it was anything but &ndash; in fact, more than just being a document describing the pragmatic workings of the government, the Constitution represented ideas that were nearly as revolutionary as the Declaration itself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always struck by the differences and similarities between the revolutions of 1776 and 1789 &ndash; the idealistic and the pragmatic &ndash; and how our country has needed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->both<!-- raw HTML omitted --> throughout the last 216ish years to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>The Constitution is as incredible a piece of thinking about how a complex government should work as has ever been written &ndash; it&rsquo;s been incredibly robust throughout our history &ndash; but without the Declaration, it would likely be just another government document that nobody really cares about (most constitutions are).</p>
<p>The Declaration, with its transcendant advocacy of human rights, would be little more than a beautiful poem without the force of the Constitution to make the ideas and ideals real.</p>
<p>So: Happy Independence Day. I hope everyone can take a bit of time to just reflect that even in a time where things look bleak some days and there&rsquo;s a lot of fighting domestically and abroad, we live in a spectacular country that is unlike any other.</p>

			 <p>As part of my new job (more on that in a bit), I&rsquo;ve decided to use a Mac for a while instead of a PC. I&rsquo;m finding it a really big adjustment. Some context: I&rsquo;ve been around Apple &amp; Macs for a really long time. Mom bought a Mac Plus when I was in high school; Dad &amp; I each bought Powerbooks in the early 90s; I worked at Apple in 94-95 and again in 1997, and my dad, mom, Kathy &amp; my brother have all been using Macs with OS X for several years now. I&rsquo;ve been mostly using a PC for my own stuff, though, since we started Reactivity back in 1998.</p>
<p>And this is almost a cliche type of thing to post, but holy cow. This is not the Mac I&rsquo;m used to. There are some major, major differences in the way it wants you to work, to organize things, and to communicate. Undeniably shiny &amp; lickable. The UI and the hardware are both just amazing. And most everything works, honestly. I&rsquo;m finding the key combinations pretty unfamiliar, so that&rsquo;s going to take some working out, and I really find the way that OS X layers open windows to be dreadfully confusing &ndash; I get lost a lot.</p>
<p>They did a really great job on Spotlight though. Makes a ton of stuff easier. Since I&rsquo;m going through so many other changes at the same time, I&rsquo;m going to try to use Spotlight for most all of my shell navigation. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve got lots of specific thoughts that I should post on (like what a pain it was to get my contacts &amp; calendar moved from Outlook to the native applications), but that&rsquo;s a start. Not sure yet whether I&rsquo;ll be more productive or not; but the UI is a whole lot shinier (in a good way, I think).</p>

<p>This is, I think, the first work of fiction that I&rsquo;ve read that is firmly rooted in a post-9/11 world. Also the first book that I&rsquo;ve read by the extremely accomplished Ian McEwan.</p>
<p>As the title suggests, this story all takes place on a single Saturday &ndash; it&rsquo;s told from the point of view of an English neurosurgeon. Some of the things that happen on this particular Saturday are mundane, some are exceptional, but it&rsquo;s really just the story of this man and his relationships, at a particular point in time.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an okay book, but not super-compelling. It is interesting to consider the huge variety of things that each and every one of us do and think about &ndash; from whether to make your own coffee, to what to have for dinner, to our place in the world, to our relationships.</p>
<p>He also explores pacing of fiction a little bit, in relationship to poetry (the main character&rsquo;s daughter is a poet, and as a scientific type, he struggles to understand her). Here&rsquo;s a quote that I particularly liked:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not that I really know what &ldquo;trout tickling&rdquo; is, but a nice thought, nonetheless. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a fair amount about what novels are lately &ndash; will post some of that in a post soon about Jonathan Safran Foer &ndash; so this is interesting.</p>

			 <p>Mom &amp; Adam both posted excellent comments on my Libraries as Endangered Species post, and I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it enough over the past couple of days that instead of putting in my own comment on that thread, I wanted to start a new post.</p>
<p>One of the things that both mentioned is interesting, and something that (almost) everyone agrees is a baseline for the function of a library: to insure some level of information access to every resident (citizen?) of the US with some level of privacy. Adam correctly notes that most of the substitute goods that are taking the place of the library (broadband, Amazon, etc.) are generally expensive.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m on board with this: a basic, non-negotiable function of public libraries in America should be to provide free &amp; private information access to anyone.</p>
<p>But I think that isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>I feel like that boils public libraries down into something that is functional, but not inspirational, not liberating, not empowering, not community-building. I feel like information access &ndash; through a rack of magazines, or a set of books, or the screen of an Internet terminal &ndash; only delivers on maybe 10% of the promise of libraries. Libraries can be more, and I think that in previous years they have been more. They&rsquo;ve been places where people gather &ndash; community groups, author lectures, your city council, school groups. They&rsquo;ve been places where people reach out to others in the community &ndash; the Bookmobile, for instance. They&rsquo;ve been places where people are entertained &ndash; story time for kids, reading individually, etc.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m struggling with. It seems to me that we live in an extremely utilitarian time. We only tally up measurable outcomes; we only use tax dollars or electoral leverage to implement things that are strictly legislated. I think that public libraries can &amp; should be more than devolving into physical access terminals for information &ndash; but I guess that I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to describe that or how to head towards there in today&rsquo;s climate.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Tom Friedman said in his most recent book <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The World is Flat<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that&rsquo;s his message to his daughter who&rsquo;s just gone off to college:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think that maybe <!-- raw HTML omitted -->imagination<!-- raw HTML omitted --> should be one of the organizing principles for public libraries. Helping everyone to build their imaginations and to act on them. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to start thinking about for my Board of Trustees application &ndash; let me know what you think&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I got a library card for the Sunnyvale Public Library yesterday, after 6 years of living here. Cynically, I got it because I&rsquo;m in the process of writing up an application to be on the Board of Trustees of the library here, and it seemed like I should probably be a member of the library first. (Although I&rsquo;ve given literally hundreds of books to SPL over the past few years, I haven&rsquo;t actually gotten a card.) More optimistically, I wanted to spend some time thinking about the role of libraries in general, and this one specifically, in our lives. And of course, with a new baby on the way, I wanted to think some about what the world will look like as s/he grows up with respect to public libraries.</p>
<p>I think most everyone who reads this knows that my mom is a Professional Librarian, and lately works for Ingram Books helping libraries develop their collections. Add to that I live in a family that basically reveres books. My grandmother ran her own bookstore for about the whole time I was growing up (I used to love visiting) and works in a bookstore even now, in her eighties. My mom &amp; dad always have had books in their hands and shelves full of them. And I read a little bit compulsively &ndash; it&rsquo;s almost a nervous tic for me. (That&rsquo;s the subject of another post that I want to do.)</p>
<p>Having said that, I don&rsquo;t actually think that libraries are really in the book business &ndash; I think they haven&rsquo;t been for a long time. With newspapers, magazines, audio, video, DVDs, software, and lately the Internet, it seems to me that they&rsquo;re in the information access business. But that misses the point, too, I think &ndash; because as I was there this week, there were lots of different things going on &ndash; kids reading together, parents showing their kids how to look up information, lots of things.</p>
<p>But I have to be honest. I don&rsquo;t use the library very much at all. For my information needs, I pretty much use my setup at home. For books, I buy an obscene number of them from Amazon or Borders (and get a huge amount from Mom as well). And when I walk around the library &ndash; any library &ndash; I just get the sense that they&rsquo;re behind the rest of the world and struggling to keep up. When I see things in the library that I think are especially current, I always think to myself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised they have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> here.&rdquo; Like the new Tom Friedman book. Or the new Alias season on DVD. I wish I didn&rsquo;t have that reaction, but I do.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of things conspiring to make the role of the library a tricky one to figure out. The emergence of the Internet. The incredible volume of media sharing happening online. Broadband to the home. Starbucks as a &ldquo;third space&rdquo; to meet &amp; hang out. Tapped out local &amp; state budgets. The Patriot Act.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that libraries should just be places where folks without access get access. I don&rsquo;t think that they should just be places where people can get books or DVDs without buying them. But I&rsquo;m having some trouble figuring out exactly what they should be. What they can be.</p>
<p>I believe that, along with public education, public libraries stand as one of the great &amp; startling legacies of the founders of our country (not just the founding fathers, but a broader set than that). I think there is a place for community-based (as opposed to school-based) centers for learning &amp; communication. I hope that libraries, as they continue to respond to pressure from every side, can figure out how to be all that they can be.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got any ideas, give a holler. I&rsquo;ve got to put something smart into my application in the next couple of weeks. :-)</p>

<p>This is an important book for folks in the software industry &ndash; it&rsquo;s the first comprehensive, academic account of what&rsquo;s happened in open source software over the last decade and half (and actually back to the AT&amp;T Unix days). Steven Weber is a political scientist at Cal, and generally takes that type of analysis on the phenomenon (occassionally views it through economics, too).</p>
<p>The book has an introductory section, which should be accessible to everyone, then a relatively meaty history of open source &ndash; my favorite part of the book, because it ties a lot of things together (for example, why the BSD license looks the way it does) that was happening just at the beginning of my Silicon Valley consciousness. Most of the middle fo the book talks about how it works (pretty remedial for someone who&rsquo;s in the industry), leading up to micro &amp; macro foundations about why it works. I found that part of the book clearly the most academic and tough to get through, but probably the most useful in the long term. I don&rsquo;t really feel like Weber quite captures the emotional reasons for why people engage, but it isn&rsquo;t bad. One thing that he misses entirely is the differentiation between server/headless components like operating systems &amp; libraries versus applications like Firefox &ndash; and I think we&rsquo;re finding already that the differences are significant.</p>
<p>The book was a little longer than I think it needs to be &ndash; just gets more esoteric towards the end &ndash; but I think it&rsquo;s organized in a way that you can pick &amp; choose what you want to read and it&rsquo;ll be very worth your time.</p>

<p>The most current of the series, Book 5 is also the longest &amp; most complex of the Harry Potter books, really emphasizing relationships outside of Hogwarts almost more than inside the school itself. I re-read this book very quickly (maybe 3 or 4 days, which I know is not as fast as some of the 10-year-olds I know read it when it came out) &ndash; I find that the books get a healthy momentum going and you really just want to see how things turn out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that I like this book as much as the 4th book &ndash; and I think it&rsquo;s probably a little too long, really, but still really enjoyable, and you can start to see the outlines of what&rsquo;s going to happen in the final two books in the series. Definitely looking forward to the new installment in July.</p>

<p>A fun vacation book to read &ndash; wanted to read some of Dick&rsquo;s work because it&rsquo;s been so influential on Jonathan Lethem.</p>
<p>You may not know Philip K. Dick by name, but you&rsquo;ve undoubtedly seen movies based on his work: &ldquo;Blade Runner,&rdquo; &ldquo;Minority Report,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Total Recall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A really smart sci-fi book published in 1969 &ndash; one of the intersting &ldquo;ahas&rdquo; that I&rsquo;ve had lately is that every future-looking novel written before about the year 2000 is always going to seem markedly different than sci-fi written afterwards, because of the Internet. We live in such a differently &amp; massively connected world now that it&rsquo;s impossible to think about the future without assuming that connectivity. That hasn&rsquo;t always been the case.</p>
<p>Anyway, fun book &ndash; great to read on vacation. (Although, like a lot of Dick&rsquo;s work, not incredibly positive in outlook on the human race&hellip;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned here a few times that Jonathan Lethem is one of my favorite authors (most recently when describing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Disappointment Artist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.) As I was looking around for books to take on vacation that were fun to read, I had an urge to read some old, more traditional science fiction, and this qualifies pretty well.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gun<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is Lethem&rsquo;s first novel, and most everyone describes it as an interesting mix of influences between Raymond Chandler and Philip K. Dick &ndash; and that&rsquo;s accurate enough. This is a sci-fi noir book in the best sense &ndash; every sentence practically oozes cool. Here&rsquo;s the first sentence: &ldquo;It was there when I woke up, I swear. The feeling.&rdquo; Classic.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of my favorite books in this genre, and the only one featuring kangaroos that carry guns and can talk.</p>

<p>The 4th Harry Potter book is my very favorite in the series so far. It&rsquo;s the first move into a more adult world, and you get your first glimpses into the world outside London &amp; Hogwarts &ndash; you get introduced to the other wizarding schools, learn more about the other groups (like the House Elves &amp; the Giants), and the coming war. Up until this point, the books have really been mostly about Harry &amp; his friends learning what it means to grow up &ndash; but this book marks a shift towards the bigger conflict &amp; context. Reading this book is the first time when I really felt like there was a huge universe outside of just what Rowling has written.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things I&rsquo;m finding is that I wanted to pace myself on these books, reading maybe one a month leading up to the 6th book release in July, but they&rsquo;ve got such a great momentum that I&rsquo;m going much faster than I thought. I&rsquo;m already almost finished with the fifth one &ndash; will have to find something else to keep me amused until July, I suppose. :-)</p>

<p>Written in 1959 by a native Nigerian, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things Fall Apart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was maybe the first really non-Western novel that I ever read, during my first quarter at Stanford. I was completely blown away by the book then, and wanted to re-read it now to see what I thought (I&rsquo;ve also been reading some histories of Africa lately that I need to post about, so am interested in other points of view).</p>
<p>The title is taken from a poem called &ldquo;The Second Coming&rdquo;, by W.B. Yeats &ndash; an incredibly powerful poem &ndash; here are the lines from it that are quoted at the beginning of the book:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was struck reading this book that it really tells two stories: one that&rsquo;s really about Africans and the introduction of outsiders, colonizers, and new technologies, but another that&rsquo;s more universal about how hard it is to hang on to the past and fight against change. And whether it&rsquo;s worth it or not.</p>
<p>Anyway, I like this novel now as much as I did when I read it 16 years ago &ndash; very glad to have gone back to it. It&rsquo;s such a simple story but really very powerful.</p>

<p>This is one of the huge mass of books coming out in the for-kids-and-sort-of-like-Harry-Potter genre &ndash; I&rsquo;ve always liked those &amp; had fun reading them, so figured it&rsquo;d be a fun book for our vacation. This particular book is notable in that it features a heroine instead of a boy, and is a story that a father made up to tell his daughters each night, in a serial style. It also has really terrific cover art.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the best thing about the book. The story is boring &amp; predictable; the characters are flat. Not a great book at all. Published by Scholastic, the publishers of the Harry Potter series &ndash; just trying to cash in, I&rsquo;d say.</p>

<p>The 3rd installment, and the first book that really starts setting up a world of characters and story lines that are outside of Harry&rsquo;s immediate relationships. This wasn&rsquo;t my favorite book the first time that I read it, and I sort of thought that most of it was more complicated than it needed to be. Reading it this time, though, I liked it quite a lot better. Sets up a ton of Harry&rsquo;s relationships going forward, of course, and gives a lot of clues to his character and how it&rsquo;s going to grow through the rest of the books. The 4th book, which I&rsquo;ll read shortly, has a lot more plot movement than this one (and is a little bit simpler). The other thing that I&rsquo;m struck by is that as the books progress, Harry obviously gets more mature, the subject matter gets more mature, and the structure of the books get more mature. This is a pretty amazing thing that Rowling has done, which is to create a series of books that grows up along with the reader. I tend to undervalue these books sometimes because of the incredible hype that they&rsquo;ve received &ndash; re-reading them reminds me that they&rsquo;re just terrific.</p>

<p>This coming Monday is my annual favorite day of the year. Why? It&rsquo;s the first work day (for those of us that are actually working) of Daylight Saving Time &ndash; and generally the NCAA Men&rsquo;s Basketball Championship game as well. Because of the game, I usually leave work on the early side (5:30p or something) and because of that, plus Daylight Saving Time (plus the progression of the Earth around the Sun, I suppose), it&rsquo;s the first day of the year that I really feel summer creeping in. Driving home with the windows open, in the daylight &ndash; it&rsquo;s just one of my favorite feelings.</p>
<p>So I was interested to read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; a recounting (and clarification) of the history of the phenomenon that we all implement but mostly don&rsquo;t understand. (First thing I learned is that it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Daylight Saving Time,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Daylight Savings Time.&quot;)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting, if esoteric, story &ndash; the idea really started in the UK in the early 1900s &ndash; a fellow suggested that to &ldquo;save the daylight&rdquo; everyone in the UK should move their clocks ahead by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->80<!-- raw HTML omitted --> minutes. Weird. There were tons of arguments for &amp; against &ndash; it turns out that farmers in all countries were overwhelmingly against (not what I thought), as were energy companies (there is some not-very-well supported evidence that springing forward could save energy &ndash; but that seems to be bogus).</p>
<p>In the US, we adopted it during WWI as part of the conservation effort &ndash; then we dropped it a few years later, and readopted during WWII for the same reason, and dropped it again a few years later. Richard Nixon made it more or less permanent during the energy crisis of the early 1970s &ndash; but exempted states that were divided by time zones (like Indiana), and that had extenuating circumstances (like Hawaii, which is more equatorial than any other state). As a result, we&rsquo;ve got a patchwork of  weird time zone rules that are always tricky to understand.</p>
<p>When you really get down to it, though, Daylight Saving Time in the US is primarily about Americans being able to spend more time outdoors during the summertime &ndash; going to baseball games, shopping, having picnics &ndash; and it&rsquo;s always been supported by the &ldquo;recreation lobbies&rdquo; like Major League Baseball, and always been opposed by Hollywood (nobody really wants to go to movies while it&rsquo;s light outside.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d really recommend this book to anyone without a ton of time on their hands :-), but encourage everyone to at least take a minute to appreciate the daylight as you spring forward this weekend.</p>

			 <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve started listening to Virgin UK radio that broadcasts in London (but I get it over the Internet, of course). I was looking for something new to listen to a few days ago and stumbled over this station &ndash; actually ended up listening to the midnight show and really liked the mix of music (how great is it when you find a DJ that seems to play all the music you like??) He been playing some good older music &ndash; &ldquo;Your Latest Trick&rdquo; by Dire Straits, &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; by Jeff Buckley, an assortment of Beatles stuff, and a lot of new stuff including the new Oasis &amp; Hoobastank &amp; Green Day (GD is among my favorites lately).</p>
<p>This morning I turned it on and suppose I&rsquo;m getting the Friday drive home show &ndash; thus I happen to know exactly where the delays are on the M5. Also, apparently one of the defenders for South Hampton will be out for the match this weekend with an injured ankle. :-)</p>
<p>I have to say that when I stop to think about it, it&rsquo;s a really shocking technological &amp; social development for me to be able to click a button and start listening to exactly what they&rsquo;re listening to in London right now (Boston&rsquo;s &ldquo;More than a Feeling&rdquo;). With our baby coming, it&rsquo;s fun to think about what life was like 35ish years ago when Kathy &amp; I were born, and what our kid will be doing 35 years from now.</p>
<p>For me, technology lately has really contributed to my quality of life &ndash; I listen to a LOT more music than I ever did, I take &amp; view a LOT more pictures of friends &amp; family, I talk &amp; write to my friends &amp; family more than I used to, and I read a ton more about current events &amp; history on the web than I ever could have in just the newspaper.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll all look back on this period and view it as a sort of Golden Age &ndash; a hyper-connected, very syncretic time &ndash; when everyone was figuring out what it means to know instantaneously what other people in the world are doing. Talking with my friend Mike yesterday, he likened it to the year 1968 &ndash; a time of tremendous uncertainty &amp; fear in the world (Vietnam, MLK &amp; RFK, Biafra), but also a time of tremendous creativity (Rolling Stones &amp; Beatles doing their best work, the start of the women&rsquo;s movement, and students taking on Soviet tanks in Czechoslovakia).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to focus on the news of insurrections, fighting, clashes of civilizations &ndash; makes you forget sometimes the incredible strides that we&rsquo;re making in terms of making the world a smaller, more intimate, more connected place. Like I&rsquo;ve said before, I&rsquo;m an unbridled optimist on this stuff &ndash; I know that there&rsquo;s a very long way to go and a lot to do, but when you just pause and think about the things taht we&rsquo;re doing now versus what the world was doing 35 years ago, it seems to me to net out very positively.</p>

<p>This book was suggested to Kathy &amp; me by Kathy&rsquo;s dad &ndash; the full title is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mexifornia: A State of Becoming<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it&rsquo;s a book about the increasingly bi-cultural state of California. I say bi-cultural instead of multi-cultural, because Hanson, who&rsquo;s a UC professor who grew up in the Central Valley, argues that there are two basic cultures here: American and Mexican &ndash; and that all immigrants basically choose to be part of one or the other (he argues that Asian immigrants have been far more successful in integrating into American culture). There are lots of reasons for this, and lots of implications in the book, but the main argument that he makes is this: multi-culturalism as we practice it today gets most things wrong. All cultures aren&rsquo;t equally good at creating stability, wealth, or a high standard of living, he says, and we&rsquo;re silly to pretend that they are. He also makes that point that immigrants to California that have basically assimilated have done far better than those who have brought overmuch of their culture with them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what I think of this book. It&rsquo;s a little tough to even blog about, because the topic is so sensitive. But I guess I&rsquo;m glad that someone is writing about it at least a little bit.</p>

<p>Also known as &ldquo;NPR&rsquo;s &lsquo;Math Guy&rsquo;&rdquo;, Keith Devlin runs the Center for the Study of Language and Information at Stanford, as well as the new MediaX group. This is an interesting book about how math is natural and innate &ndash; in humans and animals (the full title of the book is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Math Instinct: Why you&rsquo;re a Mathematical Genius (Along with Lobsters, Birds, Cats and Dogs)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>Goes through a lot of examples of what he calls &ldquo;natural math&rdquo; &ndash; the ability for dogs to figure out the fastest path to a stick thrown in the ocean, for example, or lobsters' ability to navigate by seeing the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field.</p>
<p>What I found most interesting, though, are 2 observations about natural math in humans:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Our ability to do symbolic math is very highly correlated to our language ability (different native languages are easier to do math in, for example).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Math that&rsquo;s connected to meaning is always easier for people to get approximately correct than &ldquo;school math&rdquo; &ndash; math we do in the supermarket, for example, is almost always approximate, and in general we&rsquo;re correct more of the time compared to when we do math on paper. Because in the first case it means something to us, while in the 2nd it&rsquo;s an abstraction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretty easy read; some interesting insights here.</p>

<p>The picture on the book jacket for this book is one of my favorite of all times &ndash; so suggestive.</p>
<p>I was really interested in reading this book &ndash; it&rsquo;s a series of essays that make up a sort-of-memoir of Jonathan Lethem, one of my favorite fiction authors (he&rsquo;s written <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Motherless Brooklyn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Fortress of Solitude<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gun with Occassional Music,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> among others.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a little bit older than I am &ndash; he&rsquo;s maybe just a little older than 40, but is one of the group of authors in Generation X that I consider more or less my contemporaries (others include Douglas Coupland and Jonathan Carroll) &ndash; and one of the defining characteristics of this generation of writers (also scriptwriters) seems to be an OCD-type obsession with the media influences of our childhood and adolescence. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Disappointment Artist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a series of stories about influences on Lethem (he saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 21 times one summer, he saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2001: A Space Odyssey<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a mind-boggling 3 times in one day (no breaks), and read every single thing ever written by Philip K. Dick (some very good, some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bad).</p>
<p>The book wasn&rsquo;t incredibly interesting to me &ndash; it turns out that he goes into gory, obsessive details (OCD, like I say) about a lot of his influences that just don&rsquo;t mean much to me: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Searchers,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Marvel Comics, John Cassavetes &ndash; but I liked understanding some of the depth of his obsessions &ndash; so familiar in form to me and my friends.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a bit from the book that I think is characteristic (of a lot of things, not just Lethem) &ndash; sorry for the length:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and then the payoff:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was my splits from Talking Heads and Stanley Kubrick and Don DeLillo that left me as indignant, ashamed, and unmoored as breakups with a girlfriend or wife, wondering who&rsquo;d failed whom.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Reflecting on it now, I sort of think just those bits were worth the price of the book and the time to read it. Talking about how a bunch of formerly deeply loved influences &ldquo;have become inscribed on the interiour surface of the eyes through which&rdquo; he looked at other works &ndash; that seems exactly right to me. It seems that it&rsquo;s more universal a theme than just for authors and their writing, but is more about growing up in a media-saturated world like we do now.</p>
<p>Anyway, while <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Disappointment Artist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ultimately wasn&rsquo;t everything I was hoping for, it gave me a bit of insight. Lethem is one of my very favorite authors of any generation, and in particular my own.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s tough for me to believe that this only showed up in the world seven years ago, in 1998. In just that short time, the characters and the stories seem to ahve become deeply embedded in our popular culture. An amazing thing, that happened incredibly quickly.</p>
<p>With the 6th installment of the series coming out in July, I wanted to go back and read through all the previous books &ndash; just to remember some of the nuance. I wasn&rsquo;t sure I was going to enjoy it, since I&rsquo;ve read some of them a couple of times already, but I really did enjoy this one. It&rsquo;s funny &ndash; it&rsquo;s an extremely familiar story to me now, but I find new stuff every time I read it.</p>
<p>With this first book in particular, you can see that Rowling isn&rsquo;t quite clear whether she&rsquo;s going to write more than just the one &ndash; it can stand alone far better than the other books in the series can (although the 2nd book is a pretty good standalone as well).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just completely bowled over by what a big vision Rowling paints in such an easy, comfortable, accessible way. There&rsquo;s a ton of depth here, hints at a larger world &amp; history, but it&rsquo;s really easy for even relatively young children to pick up and enjoy. As a contrast, I re-read some of C.S. Lewis' Narnia books a while back, and found them really stuffy and a little bit boring. That&rsquo;s not how I remember them, of course &ndash; I remember them as swashbuckling stories &ndash; but they&rsquo;re just clearly not modern books for modern readers at this point. Not like Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll post on each of the books as I read them leading up to July &ndash; for Book 1, let me just say that even after I&rsquo;ve seen the movie several times and read the book maybe three times, I don&rsquo;t get tired of it &ndash; it&rsquo;s still magical when Hagrid first comes to pick Harry up, it&rsquo;s still amazing when he plays his first Quidditch match.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to understand more about North Korea for a while now, so picked up this book at Kepler&rsquo;s a bit ago without really knowing anything about it. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s an interesting book about a particularly under-reported topic, but not one that you should really put on your reading list unless you&rsquo;re particularly interested.</p>
<p>The book talks a lot about the current DPRK leadership, and a LOT about the Korean War, American mistakes, and the resulting situation in the country. Cumings leans quite a lot to the North Korean side of the story here, and blames the US for most of the country&rsquo;s problems today &ndash; I found it to be a little over the top.</p>
<p>Having said all that, it&rsquo;s useful to try to see through how American media reports things and question whether the things that we all &ldquo;know&rdquo; to be true really are. In that way, it reminded me a little bit of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All the Pope&rsquo;s Men,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which highlights how strongly my views have been shaped by the media.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s a country that I wish I knew more about, so I&rsquo;m happy to have spent a weekend with this book. I come away thinking that it isn&rsquo;t such a crazy regime as we all are told now, but at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a small, under-resourced, isolated country that&rsquo;s pretty scared of the major powers it perceives as aligned against it. In many ways, a scared country is more frightening to me than a basically aggressive one.</p>

<p>This is another book that I&rsquo;ve had on my shelf for a while but just got around to reading &ndash; it&rsquo;s a relatively in depth look at the way that the Vatican works, how it&rsquo;s organized, how it (organizationally) thinks about issues. I found much of the content interesting, although a little bit arcane (predictably, I suppose), and the author a little more sympathetic &amp; apologetic for the Church than I would have liked. As an example, the book spends quite a lot of time going through two episodes &ndash; the sexual abuse scandal in the US, and teh Iraq war &ndash; and goes into excruciating detail on who did what, when, and why. It was a lot more detail than I expected, and it didn&rsquo;t completely change my views on the situation, but certainly gave me some other points of view to think about that are worthwhile. I&rsquo;m predicting that this book, and another of Allen&rsquo;s books, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conclave<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, will sell extremely well in the coming months or years as a new Pope takes the spot. A fine book, but I probably can only recommend it to you if you&rsquo;ve got a lot of extra time. :-)</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get through this book for most of the three years since it was published &ndash; as always, I was having some trouble getting through the bits about Adams' boyhood life (see my post about Ulysses S. Grant). I finally made it through that part &ndash; the first 100 pages or so &ndash; and the next 500 pages were really worth the effort. I&rsquo;m a sucker for presidential history in any event, and bits about the American Revolution in particular, and this is just a really interesting book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in John Adams &ndash; it&rsquo;s been interesting to me that he is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always<!-- raw HTML omitted --> talked about in comparison to Thomas Jefferson, and generally not that favorably. I think it has to do with the fact that the two were such good friends, such good collaborators, and eventually such bitter rivals &ndash; but really more to the point that they were our first two presidents who weren&rsquo;t George Washington. These two men (plus Alexander Hamilton, whose biography I&rsquo;m looking to read shortly) really established party politics in America &ndash; while GW stood above all of that.</p>
<p>When you look at the two men (Adams &amp; Jefferson), the contrasts are stark: Jefferson was from the South, Adams from the North; Jefferson was tall &amp; attractive, Adams short &amp; not; Jefferson able to write lyrically &ndash; almost hymns to freedom, Adams a very functional writer; Jefferson full of contradictions, Adams very straightforward (for the most part). Jefferson has always gotten the most attention, because he gave voice to the dreams of the American Republic &ndash; lyrics that resound even today. Adams has always looked more like a guy who came to work every day and did the work.</p>
<p>I have to say, though, that I think that&rsquo;s not a fair view. What&rsquo;s very clear as you read about John Adams is that he just did an incredible amount of the deep thinking and heavy lifting that made the Revolution and resulting Republic work. He did a lot of the unglamorous diplomacy when other countries didn&rsquo;t even really want to talk with us, he pushed through a lot of the important clauses in the early US documents, and I think he put into place a lot of the work that would ultimately result in Abolition.</p>
<p>This book is fascinating because we know a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about Adams' thoughts &ndash; because of the incredibly extensive letters that he wrote continuously &ndash; many to his wife Abigail, who seems to have been a first rate partner in every sense of the word. In these letters we get to see a bit of the person &ndash; with high hopes &amp; accomplishments, but also petty envies, perceived slights, and self-doubts.</p>
<p>One of the things that I learned in this book is that in contrast to Adams, Jefferson burned all of his correspondence with his wife Martha after she died (relatively early in life). So we&rsquo;re unable to get quite the insight into Jefferson the human being &ndash; which, ironically, seems to have made his legend even greater. We mostly know Jefferson through his public writing &ndash; that Declaration he wrote wasn&rsquo;t too bad, the Kentucky Resolutions, other things like that &ndash; and some of his (mostly) public discourse with folks like Adams. And as such, we&rsquo;re not privy to any of the more unflattering human elements that we see in Adams.</p>
<p>Reading this book, I&rsquo;m struck that John Adams was a legitmately great man (and his wife Abigail was equally amazing), and ended up doing a lot of the grungy, needed-to-get done work of starting the country. This isn&rsquo;t quite the right analogy I know, but in some ways Jefferson/Adams seems a little bit like Jobs/Wozniak to me: Promoter/Worker.</p>
<p>Great, great book.</p>

<p>This is an unusual book. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who We Are Now: The Changing Face of America in the Twenty-first Century<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is not the sort of book you read cover-to-cover. It&rsquo;s an attempt by Sam Roberts, a writer for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to comprehensively make sense of the 2000 census. (He wrote a precursor book about the 1990 census called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who We Are<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an overwhelming amount of data, ranging from what &ldquo;family&rdquo; is, to how educated we are, to incomes, to migration patterns, to race &ndash; really interesting. I found it pretty neat to just read a chapter at a time (say, the education chapter), then think about it some then come back to read a different chapter a few weeks later.</p>
<p>One main thing comes through to me: in spite of all the doomsday sentiment of the last few years, the world is getting better. A LOT better. Compared to a century ago, and even just a decade ago, people in the world generally and in the US specifically, are living longer, better, freer lives than at any point in history. Just as clearly though, there&rsquo;s a sense of enormous dissatisfaction in the country. One quote from the book:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have to ask: what&rsquo;s happened to that optimism? It sure doesn&rsquo;t exist now. Perhaps it was a naivete &ndash; 1900 was before two brutal hot World Wars and another painful Cold War &ndash; and possibly before the real knee in the curve in terms of massive technology adoption (fun to imagine the Wright Brothers and Henry Ford tinkering away). And so now we&rsquo;re smarter, or more sophisticated, or maybe just more jaded. And instead of the world looking like it can always get better, the prevailing mood seems to me to be that everything is broken.</p>
<p>Interesting book to pick up, lots to think about. Not that fun to read, but interesting for sure.</p>
<p>As for myself, I think things are better than they used to be, and get a little better almost every day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had this book on my shelf for a few years now, but didn&rsquo;t read it until just yesterday, when a VC that I was talking with suggested it &ndash; I read it in about 24 hours and am super-glad that I did, because it&rsquo;s a really tremendous book.</p>
<p>Written in 1994, it&rsquo;s an analysis of Silicon Valley versus Route 128 in Mass &ndash; and the environmental, historical, and cultural factors that have contributed to the high tech industry in each region. At core, the author points out that Route 128 built an environment with a relatively small number of huge, all-in-one companies &ndash; DEC is a good example &ndash; whereas Silicon Valley built an environment of companies that tended to be less vertically integrated, more prone to communication and sharing, and generally more flexible.</p>
<p>Lots of reasons for this &ndash; some rooted in the history of the region &ndash; MIT&rsquo;s ties &amp; access to Defense spending in DC, the generally looser nature of culture in the West, etc &ndash; but the result is that you get much more fluidity and information sharing in Silicon Valley than in Boston, which results in a stronger ecosystem that can reinvent itself as business circumstances change.</p>
<p>This book is great for other reasons &ndash; gives really good historical background on the rise of both regions, plus great histories of the 70s and 80s &ndash; stuff that I always really enjoy reading &amp; thinking about.</p>
<p>The thing that I was most struck by is how many of the things that I take for granted in my working world are unusual &amp; were pioneered here in SV &ndash; including an egalitarian working style, openness across companies, and a high degree of chatter among companies that are ostensibly competitive. Since I&rsquo;ve grown up in this environment, sometimes it&rsquo;s tough for me to see some of the unusual bits.</p>
<p>Anyway, anyone who&rsquo;s in this industry or interested in it at all should read this book. You can read it in literally 1 day, and it&rsquo;s really worth it.</p>

<p>Not all of you know this, I don&rsquo;t think, but my mom is a librarian. Actually, she currently works for the library division of a book distributor called Ingram Books &ndash; the same folks that supply Amazon, among others.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s a great job for her to have, and she really likes it &ndash; and it results in great windfalls for Kathy &amp; me, and others in the family &ndash; every few weeks, boxes of books &amp; audiobooks just show up on my doorstep. It&rsquo;s always a mix of stuff &ndash; all things that the publishers are sending to Ingram (and other distributors) to get noticed. I have to say it&rsquo;s just an amazing perk for me &ndash; lots of times I get galley proofs of books that I&rsquo;m waiting for (like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blink<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), but as often as not, there are books in there that I never would have picked up in the bookstore but seem interesting. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blindsided<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is one of those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a book written by a prominent television news producer, Richard M. Cohen &ndash; he&rsquo;s worked with Cronkite, Rather, others &ndash; and happens to be married to Meridith from The View. He was diagnosed when he was 25 years old with MS &ndash; like his father and grandmother before him. He goes through what his life has been like for the past quarter century or so &ndash; in a high level of candor &ndash; ups &amp; downs.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, this book isn&rsquo;t something that I normally would have picked up &ndash; I was a little bit interested in the title &ndash; I have pretty horrific eyesight and always am nervous about the idea of that eroding over time and preventing me from doing things that I love to do (like reading). But lately I&rsquo;ve known other folks in my life that I&rsquo;m close to who are grappling with life-altering health issues, and it&rsquo;s becoming more interesting to me now. I&rsquo;m quite sure that I didn&rsquo;t understand &ndash; couldn&rsquo;t understand &ndash; a bunch of what Cohen was trying to communicate in this book &ndash; but I did enjoy it and learned a lot from it. I&rsquo;d recommend it for anyone who&rsquo;s at all interested in this type of stuff.</p>
<p>Also, I have to say that Mom is a pretty great librarian &ndash; she always seems to find me books that I like but would never have found.</p>

<p>This biography of President Grant starts with a quote of his: &ldquo;I read but few lives of great men because biographers do now, as a rule, tell enough about the formative period of life. What I want to konw is what a man did as a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, not me. I find the childhood parts of biographies pretty uninteresting. I like the parts about the interesting things these people did. And I have to say that it&rsquo;s a good thing that this particular bio is only 150 pages long, because, as presidents go, Grant was not a particularly interesting one. He did some interesting things &ndash; was in the army, fought in Texas, got booted because of a drinking problem &ndash; and turned out to be a solid, if not brilliant Civil War general, helped mostly by the numerical superiority of the North &ndash; and was the president who presided over Reconstruction. But beyond that, not too much interesting about the man. Didn&rsquo;t have a lot of his own political views, didn&rsquo;t do much after his presidency. But I suppose you have to say that he cared a lot about healing the country after the Civil War, and took actions that certainly weren&rsquo;t punitive, and probably went a long way towards making it one nation again.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like I didn&rsquo;t like the book &ndash; it&rsquo;s pretty well-written, and I read it in a day and a half &ndash; just tough, slightly mundane content to work with, in terms of presidential biographies. Next in the Boring Lives of Presidents Series: James K. Polk.</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>

			 <p>So the windows project is officially done &ndash; this weekend I painted the stucco outside the house that they put around the windows. And I can categorically say that painting the outside of the house is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->waaay<!-- raw HTML omitted --> harder than painting the inside. First of all, I found out that stucco is actually pretty sharp &ndash; rough on your knuckles. And since it&rsquo;s bumpy, tough to get paint into all the little valleys. Also, what looks like &ldquo;not a lot of wall&rdquo; on the outside &ndash; turns out to be a whole lotta wall. Just doesn&rsquo;t look as big as when you&rsquo;re looking at rooms inside.</p>
<p>But anyway, it&rsquo;s done now, plus the grout just got done on our patio. So they&rsquo;re looking at putting in plants this week or next week &ndash; pretty exciting!</p>

<p>This is a fun book with mini-biographies of all 43 American presidents &ndash; with pictures, quotes, and historical context, plus the full text of each of their inaugural speeches. A really good overview. It&rsquo;s published by DK, which is one of my favorite publishers &ndash; all of their books are particularly well produced, have beautiful graphics, and are just cool to read. One of the things that I was struck by when reading this is how much the office of hte presidency changes over time &ndash; during some periods it&rsquo;s incredibly meaningful and creates major change in our society &ndash; at others, it&rsquo;s almost invisible. Really nicely put together book &ndash; I&rsquo;d recommend you borrow it from me if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>

			 <p>I almost forgot one of the most interesting pieces of blogging (although one that I don&rsquo;t really use): as a means for starting a discussion. Some of the celebrities in the blogosphere will post something like: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on a plane for most of today. Go check out this interesting link. Discuss, but be nice.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not kidding &ndash; Dan Gillmour (former SJ Merc writer) has done this, John Battelle (former Industry Standard chief and current writer of a book about Google) has done it, and my friend Mitch Kapor (founder of Lotus, EFF, and OSAF) does it as well. And the amazing thing is that because all of these guys have communities that actively read &amp; participate in their blogs, people <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have discussions in the comments of the posts. Very interesting. Sort of like that SNL skit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Coffee Talk<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ll give you a topic: the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy nor Roman. discuss.

			 <p>A week or two ago I posted something about how my blogging is &ldquo;bursty&rdquo; &ndash; that is, I tend to do my blogging in clumps of 4 or 5 messages every few weeks. Unlike the real powerhouse blogs on the web that do multiple messages each day. One of my good friends (Nikhyl)  wondered if it&rsquo;s because my posts tend to be sort of long and deep &ndash; that I spend a fair amount of time thinking about things before I really write them down. (As an aside, I&rsquo;m beginning to think this is a character trait of me, which is strange to get used to, because a lot of times I say the first dumb thing that pops into my head.) Nikhyl further noticed that the trend in blogs is actually away from this type of post, and more towards the 3 line or 1 photo snapshot of what the person is doing/what the latest gadget is/whatever.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Nikhyl&rsquo;s comment reminded me of: back in 1990/91 at Stanford, when I started to exchange e-mail with my dad. It was sort of a funny set of exchanges: he&rsquo;d send me pretty long e-mails that were essentially letters that you&rsquo;d mail in a previous time. I&rsquo;d send back incredibly emotional 2 line responses that were basically along the lines of: &ldquo;hey &ndash; got your note &ndash; life is going great here.&rdquo; Not exactly tear-jerkers. Funnily enough, when I was at my dad&rsquo;s house last summer, we found some of his old letters home from school &ndash; and while they weren&rsquo;t e-mail, they were much more in line with my notes from Stanford than my dad&rsquo;s notes to me.</p>
<p>I guess I had in my head that over the first few years of e-mailing my dad, that our styles converged, and that we ended up exchanging medium-sized messages with each other. But I now think that&rsquo;s wrong. What really happened is that it became okay to send a one-line message. And also okay to send a longer, letter-type message. And which form it took was meaningful as well.</p>
<p>The very first thing that I thought to myself when Nikhyl brought up his point is this: &ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;m using blogs like they&rsquo;re e-mail, and I&rsquo;m missing the essential &ldquo;blogginess&rdquo; &ndash; just like beginner e-mailers use e-mail like it&rsquo;s pen &amp; paper &amp; postage.&rdquo; It made me feel a little outdated, honestly.</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a while, though, I think there are just lots of different reasons why people write, e-mail, blog, whatever. Sometimes you really do want to communicate a blow-by-blow of the events that are happening in your life. Sometimes you want to just capture a fleeting idea/feeling/image. Sometimes you want to communicate an idea to the people in the world that are closest to you. I think some people do it to feel more connected with friends and family. And sometimes you just need to have a formal way to articulate things that are swirling around in your head. I do a lot of that last bit &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure why drafting ideas in the form of a post or an e-mail helps, but it does. It means that I&rsquo;ve got to try to communicate with the hope of being understood &ndash; maybe it makes me work harder to get my point out. But I suppose there are lots of reasons above &amp; beyond what I just mentioned.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t really know. I think it&rsquo;s an interesting thing. My big insight here I think is just this: everyone is different. It&rsquo;s nice that blogs can support a small portion of that diversity.</p>

			 <p>[I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this post for a few weeks now, but kept pushing it off.  Trapped here at home as I am right now, with painters painting our new windows, now seems like as good a time as any.]</p>
<p>As everyone who reads this knows, I left Reactivity, the company I founded with BJR &amp; BJR, in December, after 7 years there, in just about every role and job you can imagine. Reactivity is doing well &ndash; really well, in fact &ndash; continuing to close new customers, getting good reviews in the press, and really serving customers well. And to be honest with you, while there were some parts of my job that I didn&rsquo;t like all that much (150,000 miles flown in a year is a lot), on most days I liked what I did. But I still decided to walk away.</p>
<p>Lots of reasons &ndash; ones that I feel good about &ndash; but that&rsquo;s not what I wanted to talk about in this posting. What I wanted to talk about is how I feel having left. I guess I thought that it would be an extremely emotional thing to do, and I&rsquo;d be feeling it now, weeks later. But it&rsquo;s been remarkably emotion-free for me. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand: I care about &amp; miss some of the folks there that I built the business with and worked shoulder-to-shoulder with.  But it isn&rsquo;t an emotional thing. I don&rsquo;t have separation anxiety from Reactivity or anything like that &ndash; every once in a while in a meeting I&rsquo;ll feel a little funny not having business cards, or having to explain who I am &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not really a big deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m feeling in this emotion-light way &ndash; although I have a few theories. (Incidentally, I had lunch the other day with a friend who founded and walked away from his own company (Vividence) &ndash; he&rsquo;s had this same reaction.)</p>
<p>One theory is that after 7 years at Reactivity, with a restart, multiple tricky financings and a lot of ups &amp; downs, there just wasn&rsquo;t much emotion left. But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Another theory that I have that I think is probably correct is that Reactivity has given me a confidence that I&rsquo;ll always (or often, at least) be able to create and find environments that I' m really happy in .  Which means that while I&rsquo;m proud of what we built there, and enjoyed many of the pieces, I have a feeling that I&rsquo;ll be able to find or create good places to be going forward. They won&rsquo;t be the same, of course &ndash; and I think there&rsquo;s probably no experience like starting your very first company &ndash; but I have a confidence that things will work out just fine.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure that this will make sense to anyone but me, but wanted to capture what I&rsquo;m feeling.</p>

			 <p>Murakami is one of my favorite authors, even though he writes in Japanese. I&rsquo;ve read him now through three different translators (Philip Gabriel is the latest, Alfred Birnbaum was my favorite), and his unique writing style always provides enjoyment for me. Most of his books deal with the lost &ndash; that is, in every book, characters are missing something, and ultimately go off looking for it. While this wasn&rsquo;t my favorite book of his (I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wind-up Bird Chronicle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is his best, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Wild Sheep Chase<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the most fun), I think it&rsquo;s his best in a while &ndash; it&rsquo;s a return to big, weighty books (his last couple have been very short). Like most all of his books, there&rsquo;s a lot there, and a lot to think about, and not so many answers. A good novel for me &ndash; but not a masterpiece like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wind-up<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>As they&rsquo;re unwinding our house, I feel like we&rsquo;re peering back into time a little bit. Take off the paint, reveal multiple coatings of stucco, applied over decades. Under the stucco, mostly redwood beams, because there were so many redwoods here in 1957, when the house was built (and they thought that termites might not have much taste for it). A little bit like a housing anatomy lesson, seeing everything laid bare. At this moment, they&rsquo;re working on the big plate glass windows in our living room &ndash; having a tough time getting the glass out &ndash; 50 years of glue, I suppose. Anyway, led me to think about what was happening in 1957 when the house was built. A few items that I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->American Bandstand<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leave It To Beaver<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perry Mason<!-- raw HTML omitted --> premier</li>
<li>Steve Allen was the host of &ldquo;The Tonight Show&rdquo;</li>
<li>Dwight Eisenhower was president; the Cold War was getting colder</li>
<li>Mao Tse Tung was in control in China</li>
<li>1st US attempt to launch a satellite fails: Vanguard rocket blows up</li>
<li>Sputnik I &amp; II were launched</li>
<li>1st electric portable typewriter placed on sale (Syracuse NY)</li>
<li>3 B-52s leave Calif for 1st non-stop round the world flights</li>
<li>B-52 bombers begin full-time flying alert in case of USSR attack</li>
<li>Althea Gibson became 1st black tennis player to win Wimbledon</li>
<li>Congress passes Civil Rights Act of 1957</li>
<li>Little Rock HS integration happens; US Army is called in</li>
<li>Buddy Holly &amp; Crickets record &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll Be the Day&rdquo;</li>
<li>Hank Aaron was the NL MVP</li>
<li>Giants move to SF; Dodgers move to Brooklyn. Everyone continues to hate the Yankees</li>
<li>Dr. Seuss wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Cat in the Hat; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ayn Rand wrote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Atlas Shrugged
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The transistor was only 10 years old</li>
<li>Ford introduced the Edsel; everyone was driving their &lsquo;57 Chevy anyway</li>
<li>John &amp; Kathy&rsquo;s house was built</li>
</ul>
<p>And a bunch of other stuff, including, you guessed it, turmoil in the Middle East, centered around Sinai.  Here&rsquo;s a piece of the Eisenhower Doctrine, announced in 1957:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&hellip;</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;p&gt;The occasion has come for us to manifest again our national unity in support of freedom   and to show our deep respect for the rights and independance of every nation - however   great, however small. We seek, not violence, but peace. To this purpose we must now devote   our energies, our determination, ourselves.

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve decided that our house is now the absolute perfect place to live if you&rsquo;re 3. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are huge construction trucks in the road in front of the house (they&rsquo;re doing some sort of street resurfacing that I don&rsquo;t completely understand), including scrapers, graders and steamrollers (just like busytown)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are big panel trucks in our driveway (bringing new flagstone for our backyard, new windows for our house)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are 5 guys on the premises each working a power tool that makes smoke &amp; dust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are actual gaping holes in the house where windows once were and may be again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s noisy, so no naps for anyone, including me (Actually, I should say that it&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unbelievably noisy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; they&rsquo;re actually taking apart our house, bit by bit.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and we have a room full of toys for the nieces and nephews, plus some string cheese. Yum.</p>
<p>You might imagine that for a 34 year old, it isn&rsquo;t currently the perfect house. But it&rsquo;s getting better, and will be in good shape in the coming weeks and months. I&rsquo;m optimistic that all of the major window-sized holes will be gone shortly. Good thing we live in California.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are high class problems, I suppose, getting new windows &amp; a new backyard &amp; being home all day to be bothered by all the work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a bunch of posts right in a row now with pictures from the backyard &amp; house showing in process window stuff.</p>

			 <p>I thought that George W. Bush&rsquo;s 2nd Inaugural was a very good speech. I haven&rsquo;t historically thought much of his policies, and I&rsquo;ve thought even less of his grammar, vocabulary, speaking skills and such, but thought that this speech was quite good both from the point of view of his oratory (better than it&rsquo;s been in a long time) and his policy. The devil is in the details, but I think there&rsquo;s much to be proud of in policy, which is basically committed to democracy throughout the world. I&rsquo;ve been so focused on what a crappy administration it&rsquo;s been (deceitful, naive, and mean-spirited all seem to fit the bill) that I haven&rsquo;t thought as much about democracy worldwide on the merits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it some lately, as you see the interviews with Iraqis that are planning to vote (or to stay home). And while there&rsquo;s a lot to criticize, many of these people are getting to vote on how they&rsquo;re governed for the first time in their lives &ndash; the first time in generations. And I keep coming to the conclusion that whatever the outcome, that&rsquo;s a wholly good thing to enable. It won&rsquo;t be perfect, and it will have tragic costs in countless ways, but it&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a bit of what he said: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> More to the point: the best hope for peace is both political and economic freedom in all the world.</p>
<p>This is not my own idea, take a look <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for Thomas Friedman&rsquo;s full essay. Here&rsquo;s the bit that I think is exactly right: &ldquo;So I don&rsquo;t want young Muslims to like us. I want them to like and respect themselves, their own countries and their own governments. I want them to have the same luxury to ignore America as young Taiwanese have - because they are too busy focusing on improving their own lives and governance, running for office, studying anything they want or finding good jobs in their own countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you net out W&rsquo;s speech, he said that democracy is an undeniable good, and one that we should spend time &amp; money &amp; other types of capital to foster. Thinking about it historically, this is pretty much the opposite of conservative policy (which are traditionally isolationist)  &ndash; it&rsquo;s practically a left-wing, improve the world philosophy. The differences, I suppose, are two: (1) we&rsquo;re pursuing this policy not because it&rsquo;s the right thing in the world, but because it protects our liberty at home, and (2) the means of getting their may not be something to be very proud of.</p>
<p>In any event, I was encouraged by his words and tone and posture &ndash; he is, at the end of the day, our American President, and I&rsquo;m happy to be at least a little hopeful.</p>

			 <p>For the last 30 days or so, I&rsquo;ve traveled exactly nowhere. San Francisco is about as far afield as I&rsquo;ve been &ndash; and I&rsquo;m really happy for the travel respite. In a funny way, I sort of miss airports &ndash; there&rsquo;s a certain anonymity and autonomy that comes from running around an airport by yourself with all your stuff &ndash; but I don&rsquo;t really miss them all that much.</p>
<p>Having said that, I took stock of the places that I&rsquo;ve spent time over the last couple of years. Big list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vancouver</li>
<li>Seattle</li>
<li>Los Angeles</li>
<li>San Diego</li>
<li>Las Vegas</li>
<li>Great Falls</li>
<li>Phoenix</li>
<li>Denver</li>
<li>San Antonio</li>
<li>Austin</li>
<li>Dallas</li>
<li>Houston</li>
<li>Kansas City</li>
<li>Minneapolis/St. Paul</li>
<li>Chicago</li>
<li>Saint Louis</li>
<li>Memphis</li>
<li>Nashville</li>
<li>Indianapolis</li>
<li>Atlanta</li>
<li>Jacksonville</li>
<li>Charlotte</li>
<li>Detroit</li>
<li>Pittsburgh</li>
<li>Philadelphia</li>
<li>Newark</li>
<li>Princeton</li>
<li>Manhattan</li>
<li>Long Island</li>
<li>Rochester</li>
<li>Ottawa</li>
<li>Montreal</li>
<li>Toronto</li>
<li>Hartford (Connecticut)</li>
<li>Boston</li>
<li>Dublin</li>
<li>Belfast</li>
<li>Glasgow</li>
<li>Inverness</li>
<li>Edinburgh</li>
<li>London</li>
</ul>
<p>and if I extend back a bit further, I get to include Tai Pei, Bangkok, Chang Mai, Chang Rai, parts of Burma, and recently ravaged Phuket.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll complain a lot to anyone that will listen about how tough the travel has been on my body and my psyche this year, but I want to be explicit: I feel extremely lucky to have done the traveling that I&rsquo;ve done, both internationally (I&rsquo;ve liked every place that I&rsquo;ve gone very much) and domestically. I like traveling in the US quite a lot - and am super-happy to have gotten to see as many different parts of the country as I have.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before that 2 of my very favorite authors, Douglas Coupland &amp; Haruki Murakami, have both come out with novels this month &ndash; I&rsquo;m now finished with the first book and in the middle of the second, and one of the things that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about is that it&rsquo;s pretty tough to explain why I like these two guys and their writing so much. It&rsquo;s not content &ndash; except for Coupland&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Microserfs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Murakami&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Underground<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not all that much really happens in their books. They&rsquo;re mostly books that pick up in the middle of relatively normal lives, have a bit of the fantastic in them, and that&rsquo;s sort of it. (Murakami deals with some interesting historical issues as of late that I&rsquo;ll talk about later.) I guess that with both of them, I just like how I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when I read them, what I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (almost always things in my own life), and really who I think I am and can be when I read them. It&rsquo;s strange and difficult to describe.</p>
<p>This book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eleanor Rigby<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is pretty obviously about loneliness. (You might take a look at the Beatle&rsquo;s lyrics for the eponymous song <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.) It&rsquo;s about a forty-ish woman who lives in Vancouver but has managed to live her entire life pretty much alone &ndash; and about what happens and how she changes when she suddenly has someone to be with (not romantic; different).</p>
<p>I think, though, that the bigger theme is one that Coupland has explored in all of his books that I know of: the search for meaning. Here&rsquo;s what he wrote in one of his early (1994) books <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life After God<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: &ldquo;You are the first generation raised without religion.&rdquo; Widely known as a chronicler of Generation X (and having coined  the term), he makes the point that those of us who grew up in the late 60s, 70s and 80s really grew up in a much less grounded world than the North Americans of earlier eras. And he&rsquo;s right, it seems to me: my generation does seem to believe in less than other generations (or even as I was brought up to believe). And it goes deeper than just the &ldquo;religious&rdquo; type of religion, but also extends to what I&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;secular religions: belief in country, family, neighborhood, work, etc. So most of Coupland&rsquo;s books follow characters that have always been approximately my age as they try to connect what happened yesterday with what&rsquo;s happening today with what they hope might happen tomorrow. Meaning.</p>
<p>His books are generally optimistic, I think, and have been getting more so over the years. While earlier they were more sardonic and flip about our &ldquo;GenX&rdquo; situation, now they really focus on family and friendships as central to meaning for most any life.</p>
<p>Anyway, I sure like his writing, and thinking these types of thoughts.</p>

			 <p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Tipping Point<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Malcolm Gladwell wrote that there are basically 3 types of folks you need to have a robust, spreading idea: mavens (experts), evangelists, and connectors. Anyone that knows me knows that I&rsquo;m the third type: a connector.

<p>As I&rsquo;m starting my job search, it seems to me that being a connector for other people doesn&rsquo;t always help you when you&rsquo;re trying to connect yourself. That seems to be a different skill. It&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;m working on, obviously, but it&rsquo;s an interesting difference. I also find that I&rsquo;m able to do different things, introduction-wise, when I&rsquo;m introduced to someone, as opposed to contacting them directly. I need to think more about it, but wanted to jot it down.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m finding now, though, that the process of blogging is changing the way that I read some. As I read lately, I find myself thinking through how I&rsquo;m going to talk about what I&rsquo;m reading, what I think about it &ndash; it&rsquo;s helping me to become more critical about what I read, and I think that&rsquo;s a (mostly) good thing.</p>

			 <p>This is my last Stephen R. Donaldson post, at least for a while. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Power that Preserves<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the third and final book of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; a fantasy series comparable in scope to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Lord of the Rings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that I re-read these books &ndash; there was a lot that I had forgotten, and really a lot in them to recommend. Reading all 3 of them right in a row, in the space of a week or two, though, might not have been the best idea. By the time I got to this third book, I flew through it pretty quickly just to get to the end. Perhaps as a result, I ended up thinking that this was the weakest of the three, but still reasonable &amp; satisfying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to read some other things for a while &ndash; I&rsquo;ve got a couple of novels that I&rsquo;ve been excited to read; feeling like I want to get back to some non-fiction as well.</p>
<p>I am planning to read at least one more epic fantasy series this year, though &ndash; just need to decide which. (In addition to re-reading the Harry Potter books from the start.) Thinking about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the Shanara books by Terry Brooks, or maybe even the Neil Jordan books. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

			 <p>The 2nd installment in Donaldson&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the only real fantasy trilogy that I&rsquo;ve ever read that approaches the scope of Tolkein. Actually, that&rsquo;s not quite right &ndash; the Terry Brook&rsquo;s Shanara books are similar in scope as well, and while I really enjoyed them, they always seemed to me to be directly derivative of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Lord of the Rings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Covenant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I always thought was basically the same &ndash; I read it around the same time as a kid. As I re-read the trilogy, though, I&rsquo;m revising my view. Like Tolkein with LOTR, Donaldson wrote the trilogy all at once &ndash; in what was essentially a mega-novel (Tolkein never thought of LOTR as a trilogy, really) &ndash; Tolkein in 1954; Donaldson in 1977. But while Tolkein&rsquo;s work is really a piece of a much much larger mythology, Donaldson&rsquo;s is more self-contained. I think, also, that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Covenant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series is somewhat more adult, exploring character much more &ndash; in particular, the role of belief (and unbelief), sickness, and permanency. In plot they&rsquo;re similar, in attitude they&rsquo;re different. Easy to understand why those differences wouldn&rsquo;t be apparent to me as a kid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the third installment, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Power that Preserves<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to read next &ndash; then I&rsquo;ll decide if it&rsquo;s worth it to read the 2nd trilogy. Maybe so, but I&rsquo;d like to read some other things first. I will say that it&rsquo;s great getting the chance to read these books in just a few sittings &ndash; it&rsquo;s nice to have that continuity.</p>
<p>Next on tap, three new books from some of my very favorite authors: Coupland, Murakami, and Diamond. I&rsquo;m a little overwhelmed that they all came out with books this month. :-)</p>

			 <p>Nikhyl gave me this book for Christmas &ndash; the full title is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hard News: The Scandals at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Their Meaning for American Media.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It&rsquo;s a book that I didn&rsquo;t expect to like, but really did. Nominally tells the story of Jayson Blair and the 36+ articles that he plagerized or fabricated over a period of months in his role at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Times<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but really tells a bit about the long and influential history of the paper and the people around it. The book also gives quite a lot of good insight into how newspapers, especially those that write history like the NYT, view their responsibilities to their readership, and how some of those are dealt with on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>I have to say that I&rsquo;ve only started to appreciate <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over the last couple of years &ndash; for most of my life, it&rsquo;s always seemed to me to be very specific, very insular, and just very disonnected from me and my life. Not to mention that their sports coverage is lousy, and shows a very odd obsession with George Steinbrenner. I think that I&rsquo;m beginning to understand a little bit better, and this book helped a lot, how papers like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Washington Post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wall Street Journal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> all really inform and shape the public debate. Which means that when things go wrong, like Jayson Blair, things are very bad.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s an interesting book to read &ndash; gets somewhat into the details of the people and processes, so drags a little bit in places, but the basic story and history is worth knowing. (Thanks Nikhyl!)</p>

			 <p>A lot of fun, like Moore&rsquo;s other books. As you&rsquo;d imagine, this one&rsquo;s a wacky novel about vampires. Only 2 of them, but still.

			 <p>I have to say that my last few weeks at Reactivity were about as good as I could have imagined them. I&rsquo;m going to write a different post later tonight about the emotions that I&rsquo;ve felt/am feeling, but wanted to focus this post on everyone else.</p>
<p>My transition out was relatively long, mostly happening over the last three months of 2004 &ndash; that was an intentional decision that Glenn &amp; I made together. Was probably longer than I would have liked, probably shorter than he would have liked. But in the end, I think it worked out very well. It meant that during October and November I was able to really focus on three things: (1) recruiting my replacements, (2) transitioning my customer interactions to other folks, and (3) aggressively handing responsibilities to other people at Reactivity, but in a way that I could support them while I was still around. As a result, December was a pretty easy month &ndash; took a trip to see Fidelity (one of the best organizations that I&rsquo;ve ever worked with), spent some time with the new CTO &amp; VP Products, and just generally got things into a shape that I think we can all be proud of.</p>
<p>Our holiday dinner was very touching to me as well &ndash; during a section of dinner, Glenn, Brian, Mike, Dan &amp; Bill &ndash; all pillars of Reactivity &ndash; each got up and said some very nice things about working with me. I felt like it was a little bit backwards; I&rsquo;ve been very lucky to work with each of them, and more, of course. They also made me this really cool plaque &ndash; it has a faceplate from one of our units on it, and has inscriptions from most of the folks that I&rsquo;ve worked with over the past few years. Really nice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that my interactions with our customers has been uniformly positive as well - every one was supportive, encouraging, and wanted to maintain our relationship beyond the life of Reactivity. This is the first time in my career where I&rsquo;ve had really meaningful relationships with customers, and their reactions to my departure were very important to me.</p>
<p>I have to say that all of this just reflects extremely well on everyone that I&rsquo;ve worked with, and highlights how lucky I&rsquo;ve been and how challenging it will be to find a place that&rsquo;s anywhere near as good/interesting/supportive to go to next.</p>

			 <p>Well, it&rsquo;s looking better as of this weekend &ndash; they&rsquo;ve pretty well gotten rid of all the planters, the basketball hoop &amp; the lawn, plus they&rsquo;ve reshaped the patio to be substantially what it will be sized for the finish. Today they&rsquo;re working on forms for 3 pieces of new concrete they&rsquo;ll need to pour: a little platform on the side of the patio for our grill, plus reshapings of the two stepouts (sliding doors in our living room &amp; bedroom). I think it&rsquo;s starting to look a whole lot better, even this early. Getting rid of all the concrete already makes the back look a lot more organic and less constructed. My next trick is to get our backyard neighbors to get excited about splitting the cost of a new fence with us. (They should, since their tree is what&rsquo;s pushed down our existing fence.) Pictures from this morning before any work started are here:</p>

<p>Next up, pouring the concrete, replacing the back fence (as soon as we get the okay from our neighbors), and then I think, putting the stones on the patio.</p>

			 <p>Since I&rsquo;m leaving Reactivity, I thought it&rsquo;d be appropriate to post the note that started it off back more than 7 years ago, for posterity&rsquo;s sake. I&rsquo;ll have more to say about leaving probably next week.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Last Friday, Adam, Tom Kosnik (a biz school prof who teaches at Harvard and Stanford) and I were hanging out and talking&ndash;mostly I was trying to figure out what I do next. To make a long story short, it looks for sure like ATG is going to get demolished this month, which means that Apple isn&rsquo;t a place that I want to be any more. So we were talking about startups that Tom knows that I could go to, then it occurred to me that I could start doing freelance work&ndash;there seems to be an awful lot of work to go around in the valley right now. Then Tom asked both of us what our ideal jobs would be. And, bottom line is that I really want to spend my days with people I both care about and respect, and spend my time helping to <em>create</em> something. And that my skill set seems to be helping people to connect with each other and to do cool things together.</p>
<p>One of the things that I&rsquo;m starting to realize is that nobody is going to <em>give</em> me my perfect job&ndash;and so it seems like the best way to do something fun is to just create the perfect job and figure out how to make it work.</p>
<p>Tom noted that the biggest problem in the valley right now is that nobody can find good, talented engineering or creative people&ndash;Sun has something like 1000 job openings, Intel has the same, Cisco and Oracle as well. Microsoft is going to be hiring something like 3500 people this year. But for us&ndash;everyone on the distribution list&ndash;finding talented people is about the easiest thing we can do&ndash;I know <em>tons</em> who are looking for interesting places to be. And almost everyone that I know says that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;planning to start up in a year or so&hellip;&rdquo; but just looking for the right opportunity.</p>
<p>And so Tom suggested that we just take a look at what the best biz schools and engineering schools in the country are (Stanford Engineering, Stanford GSB, MIT Engineering, MIT Biz, HBS, CMU Engineering, Cornell Engineering, Cornell Biz, Princeton Engineering) and try to figure out how to build a business built around collecting the right groups of people together.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the actual idea:</p>
<p>A metastartup (this is a temporary name only&ndash;trying to think of a better one) is a company who&rsquo;s mission is to foster a community of talented engineers and business people, with the goal of spinning off startup companies from that community, as well as to build a loosely coupled network of those companies.</p>
<p>I believe that there will be very many types of flavors to a metastartup&ndash;a couple have already emerged:</p>
<p>IdeaLab (<a href="http://www.idealab.com/)">http://www.idealab.com/)</a>: This is a company in Pasadena founded by a guy named Bill Gross. The basic idea is that he&rsquo;s got lots and lots of ideas for startups, as well as a whole bag of money, and is recruiting anybody he can get his hands on to come work on one of his ideas to start up. I think that they&rsquo;ve got 18 companies in their portfolio after a couple of years. He basically sets people up with offices, HR functions, ideas, a team, and VC. Check out <a href="http://www.herring.com/mag/issue44/gross.html,">www.herring.com/mag/issue&hellip;</a> which is an article from The Red Herring.</p>
<p>Interval Research (<a href="http://www.interval.com/)">http://www.interval.com/)</a>: Interval is a research tank of about 100 people, created by Paul Allen, and funded from 1992 to 2002 by $100M, I think. It&rsquo;s mostly composed of relatively famous designers who have made their marks in the computing industry, although there are quite a few artsy types there as well. Their business model is to be really free and loose and let their researchers work on whatever they want, and to spin off ideas whenever it seems appropriate. They&rsquo;ve got 3 spinoffs to date: Carnelian (software for traditional publishers), Purple Moon (software for girls) and Electric Planet (also software for girls). Not a lot of public information about them; they&rsquo;re extremely inwardly focused.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m thinking of, though, is less patriarchal, less funded, and more egalitarian than IdeaLab, and much more urgent, much less funded, and much less academic than Interval.</p>
<p>The model would be to have a core set of people in the metastartup, who focus on continuity, mentoring, cross-fertilization of ideas, and recruiting, and hiring mostly young people, mostly right out of school or after their first or second high tech job, for a time period between one year and two years, with the expectation that sometime in the second year of being at the metastartup, they would find a team to join that spins off, with the metastartup retaining some equity portion of the spinoff, and the spinoff retaining some reciprocal equity stake in the metastartup (and, transitively, in every other spinoff in the community).</p>
<p>Which all sounds sort of neato&ndash;but the big question is obviously how to pay everyone&rsquo;s salaries. The revenue model that I&rsquo;ve been working on so far has a few different possibilities. The obvious ideal is to have a few of the startups go public, which would presumably fund metastartup development for some reasonable length of time, and that&rsquo;s my expectation for the long term. But how to get it started? Seems like there are two possibilities (along with some versions that are mixtures of the two): venture capital funding (Tom Kosnik seems to think that this would be relatively easy to get) or self-funding, through consulting work.</p>
<p>VC has lots of different possibilities&ndash;the major advantages would be (1) a close connection with a VC&rsquo;s network and (2) cash. I think that there are a couple of disadvantages: (1) you lose quite a bit of your equity when VC&rsquo;s fund and (2) in funded ventures, people seem to have a problem with &ldquo;keeping their eye on the ball.&rdquo; That is, when your salary doesn&rsquo;t depend on execution, it&rsquo;s easy to work on something that&rsquo;s not quite critical to your business. One of the guises of a VC-connection that Adam and I just talked about is that there would be the possibility of a VC deciding that this is a really good way to develop engineering and creative talent as a resource for startups, and absorb the whole metastartup as some sort of development arm.</p>
<p>The consulting route is clearly harder, at least at first, because of the obvious problem of splitting time between what you want to be doing, developing the startups, and what pays your bills. I think that we can mitigate this problem a bit by being sort of careful about the consulting jobs we pick (there seems to be way more consulting work in the valley than anyone can do)&ndash;and trying to position the company as a sort of IDEO, that is, an advanced research company. One possible example is that a friend of mine is the CEO of an internet startup (about 100 people, I guess), and they&rsquo;re really looking to build some sort of research lab to do advanced prototyping&ndash;the metastartup could contract that work out, doing market research and prototype and technology design. I have the feeling that we could find a lot of work like that.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of other ideas in this, but it&rsquo;s really late, and I need to go to bed&ndash;one more piece, though, is one borrowed from Interval, and that&rsquo;s the idea of people in the company having a certain number of &ldquo;project points&rdquo; that they have to spend. So, for instance, you might assign everyone 20 points wehn they start&ndash;and their main project, the one that nothing takes priority over, is worth 12 points, a consulting project is worth 5 points, and smaller roles on other people&rsquo;s project might be worth 2 or 3 points each. That&rsquo;s a neat idea for at least 3 reasons&mdash;it helps cross-fertilization of talent and ideas, it gives us a way to measure % of time spent bringing in dollars, and it would give us a way to involve people at some level less than a full employee&ndash;you could imagine hiring &ldquo;associates&rdquo; or something that don&rsquo;t quit their day jobs, but get involved at the level of 5 points or so&ndash;this would be a risk reduction way to get people involved and engaged. Better than that, though, is that it would provide a way to get students still in school involved&ndash;to have associate groups at Stanford and in Boston, for instance, of students spending some % of their time working on metastartup stuff&ndash;which could be anywhere from contributing ideas from their scholarly work to doing actual consulting work. Seems like that would be a really strong hook for recruiting.</p>
<p>The last thing that I&rsquo;ll say tonight is that I believe that the metadata idea could provide a way to get away from the &ldquo;startups-that-make-the-three-founders-and-only-them-rich&rdquo; category, by focusing on building a very egalitarian group, with very open policies on equity and salary.</p>
<p>Anyway, more tomorrow night, hopefully, but I wanted to get this started at least, and hopefully get reactions to it.</p>
<p>Thanks&ndash;</p>

			 <p>My dad visited us last week, and we had a great time. It&rsquo;s the first time that he&rsquo;s been to our house, so we were happy to share with him what we&rsquo;ve done, what we&rsquo;re planning to do &ndash; lots of things like that.</p>
<p>What I wanted to write about in this post, though, is how amazing the Bay Area is. All the normal stuff is of course incredible: San Francisco is a jewel of a city, Napa/Sonoma are terrific, Stanford is super, and of course Reactivity is a highlight of any tour. But here&rsquo;s the thing: we filled up 4 days of amazing stuff <!-- raw HTML omitted -->without seeing any of that<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>First we went to Muir Woods &ndash; a place that I always feel is plucked right out of the Pliestocene. Huge trees, huge ferns, always foggy &amp; damp. You just feel like a dinosaur could step out at any moment. We were super-lucky to see salmon &amp; trout swimming upriver to spawn. Now that&rsquo;s tough work. I was particulary struck by the nature of light there &ndash; always changing, always something different. One minute you&rsquo;ll get that ambient glow of dense fog; the next you&rsquo;ll see sun streaming through the trees like a cathedral. I guess these coastal Redwoods are the little brothers of the really big trees &ndash; the Sequoias in Sequoia National Park. Still, amazing.</p>
<p>After Muir Woods, we spent a couple of hours hiking around the Marin Headlands. First, let me just say that if you want to get the best picture of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge, you&rsquo;ve got to do it from there. You can just see everything. The natural beauty of the place is stunning, and strikingly different from Muir Woods, which is very closeby. Where thoughts of the natural world dominate while you&rsquo;re in Muir Woods, though, when I&rsquo;m in the Headlands, I find my thoughts much more about the relationship between humans &amp; the environment. Here&rsquo;s what I mean: the Marin Headlands are basically built of big hills right where the San Francisco Bay connects to the Pacific Ocean (the Golden Gate). Which means 2 things: it&rsquo;s a good place to see people coming into the Bay on boats. The other thing is that it&rsquo;s a really good place to shoot at them from. In particular &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; like the Spanish or the Japanese or the Soviets. The Headlands are filled with lookout posts and army bases and missile sites. The oldest one we saw was built in 1906 &ndash; to protect the Bay against the Spanish. And the gun turret moorings for machine guns to protect us during WWII. And of course the Nike missiles to protect us against the Soviet threat.</p>
<p>I always think about how absurd these defenses look in hindsight. (Sort of like the dirigible hangars at Moffet Field.) They not only weren&rsquo;t needed as defenses, they were absurd overreactions. It&rsquo;s easy to laugh at them now and think about how scared we must have been to put them up. But I have to wonder what things that we&rsquo;re doing now &ndash; in our current over-reaction &ndash; will look absurd to future generations.</p>
<p>Even having said all that, the Headlands are a beautiful place. I can&rsquo;t recommend them highly enough.</p>
<p>We also did something that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a while now: we went to the National Steinbeck Center, in Salinas. Dad &amp; I both really love John Steinbeck&rsquo;s writing &ndash; it was fun to go see a bit of history about him and the place he grew up in. One interesting tidbit: Steinbeck worked for the Spreckles Sugar Company several summers. :-) The museum isn&rsquo;t all that big, and I think it&rsquo;s really geared more towards school field trips, but as a Steinbeck fan, I&rsquo;m glad that we went.</p>
<p>We ended up doing 17-mile drive in Monterey as well. Man. Just an amazing, beautiful stretch of Pacific coastline.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was a nice weekend, full of new &amp; old insights for me.</p>

			 <p>Really interesting pre-release book that Mom sent &ndash; it&rsquo;s about the history of electricity, from John Thomson inventing the telegraph (it wasn&rsquo;t Samuel Morse) to Alexander Graham Bell, then the history of wireless from Hertz to radar (in the 40s). A short chapter about Turing &amp; Shockley &amp; how the computer came to be, then, surprisingly, a section about how electricity makes the whole human body work. I found the beginning history interesting &amp; fun to read, and the stuff about the human body fascinating (since I don&rsquo;t know much about it). He makes the very interesting point that the idea that electricity is what runs the human body is so surprising that it took us until very recent times just to figure it out. Comes out in the next quarter or so &ndash; fun book to read.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is an interesting book that looks at the common patriarch of the 3 major monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity &amp; Islam. First Feiler goes through and talks about Abraham, what we know, what we don&rsquo;t, then he starts talking about &ldquo;all the different Abrahams&rdquo; that we have. Put another way, each religion, and indeed, each time period, tends to ascribe different characteristics to Abraham and apporpriate him for various things. He spends a lot of time talking about the relationship between Isaac and Ishmael and Abraham, and how that&rsquo;s viewed through the different lenses, as well as the divide between Hagar (Ishmael&rsquo;s mother) and Sarah (Isaac&rsquo;s). The most interesting comparisons for me were of the story in which God calls Abraham to sacrifice Isaac &ndash; how in some readings, it&rsquo;s viewed as God&rsquo;s test of Abraham&rsquo;s faith, in other&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s viewed as Abraham testing God, and in yet others, the reading is that Abraham <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actually did kill Isaac<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but Isaac came back to life.</p>
<p>I found this book much easier to read than Karen Armstrong&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A History of God<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but of course not as deep. I found intersting his focus on how we all interpret historical figures in general, and on how Abraham is an almost perfect vessel for this.</p>
<p>Good book. I&rsquo;ll try to read Armstrong&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Battle for God<!-- raw HTML omitted --> next, although I&rsquo;m having some trouble with the form and substance of her writing these days. (Just too esoteric &amp; contextualized.)</p>

			 <p>Well, I&rsquo;m not done with it yet, but this amazing book deserves some &ldquo;in the middle&rdquo; posts. I&rsquo;m about halfway through Steinbeck&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Grapes of Wrath<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and am absolutely blown away by it. This book makes me want to linger on every word, read chapters twice. Just flat unbelievable. I can&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;ve never read it before. The thing that&rsquo;s amazing to me so far is the way that Steinbeck captures the large (what was happening to America during that period) and the small (the details of the Joad family as they head from Oklahoma to California). Just amazing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something from chapter 5, where he&rsquo;s talking about the banks and the companies pushing out the families. Listen:</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s incredible to me is how perfectly that describes a million different situations in our lives today.

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll post more before I&rsquo;m done, no doubt. Just thought it was worth mentioning that I&rsquo;ll run out of superlatives by the end.</p>

			 <p>First, let me say that we had a great Thanksgiving, and really enjoyed spending time with Mom, Bampa, and Myra.</p>
<p>Second, let me say that getting to Nashville totally and completely sucked. Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of our lovely trip:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>got to the airport 2 hours before our flight, which was supposed to leave at Noon PST</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>boarded our flight 2 1/2 hours after it was supposed to leave due to weather in Chicago, where we were connecting through</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sat on the plane on the tarmac for 2 hours waiting for Chicago</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 hour flight; uneventful. but no movie. arrived 10:30p CST at ORD (figured we were late for our 7:15p flight to Nashville, but amazingly it hadn&rsquo;t taken off yet)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>spent the next 2 hours on the plane from SJC on the tarmac in Chicago, because all the gates were full &ndash; they were very very behind on the deicing machines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>got into O&rsquo;Hare at 12:30a, and (hooray!) our Nashville flight still hadn&rsquo;t left, so we went over to the gate (it&rsquo;s worth mentioning here that O&rsquo;Hare was absolutely packed with people &ndash; a lot of them sleeping on airport-provided cots in the hallways)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>waited for 90 minutes to board our plane to Nashville when they canceled it &ndash; the crew had been working for too many hours. good law. bad timing for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so we took a very bad taxi to a hilton that we had already booked (yay!) &ndash; got there at 3a, slept until 6a (in our clothes &ndash; no bags), when we caught a taxi back to O&rsquo;Hare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this time we were delayed boarding for an hour and then, guess what, sat in the plane on the tarmac for 2 hours while we waited for the fuel truck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>got to nashville where we were met by Bampa at something like 1p on Thanksgiving. waited an hour for our luggage. nope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had a great Thanksgiving dinner at Mom&rsquo;s. was perfect. seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had our bags delivered around 10p to Mom&rsquo;s house. took showers. changed clothes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tough trip. But we&rsquo;d do it again. Probably. :-)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of weeks back, I had an interesting trip where I had meetings Monday in Toronto, Tuesday in Rochester (NY), Wednesday in Montreal, and Thursday in Manhattan. Lots of different things made it interesting &ndash; each day was in a different country for one, my first trip to Montreal for another.</p>
<p>First, I have to say that I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed every trip I&rsquo;ve ever taken to Canada. Now I&rsquo;ve been to Vancouver, Victoria, Saskatoon, Toronto, Ottawa &amp; Montreal &ndash; and they&rsquo;ve all been terrific. I will say that I think Toronto is more like Vancouver than it is like Montreal, in spite of the proximity &ndash; Montreal was just something completely different, while still maintaining a sort of &ldquo;Canadian-ness&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m still trying to articulate.</p>
<p>Toronto is just a together sort of city. Things seem to run well, everything is super clean, the people are amazingly friendly (if a little embarrassed for my Americanness). If not for the bitter cold that&rsquo;s coming, would be a great place to live. The day we were there was beautiful &ndash; brilliant and clear and crisp.</p>
<p>We drove from Toronto down around Lake Ontario to get to Rochester, about which I have very little positive to say. Rochester seems a lot like Detroit to me &ndash; a place that history has passed by. Rochester is towered over by the Kodak building &ndash; you&rsquo;ve probably seen it in pictures &ndash; an old art deco style building with &ldquo;KODAK&rdquo; in big red neon letters. Anyway, was a short trip there, and just as well.</p>
<p>Montreal was new for me. What an interesting place. The day that I was there, it was particularly cold and overcast &ndash; and man, is it French. I had a distinct feeling of being an outsider &ndash; a &ldquo;just visiting&rdquo; feeling that I haven&rsquo;t really had anywhere else in North America. I think a lot of folks assume that Montreal is more French than Canadian, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem so to me. It still seems very Canadian in attitude, relationship to space &amp; wilderness, etc. I will say that French is a much much more attractive language than English. Every time I went to speak to someone they started out in French, then quickly changed to English (once they figured out I was a lost cause) &ndash; and the English just was much more nasal and, frankly, bad sounding.</p>
<p>Manhattan finished up the trip &ndash; I spoke at a breakfast on Wall Street in the morning, and basically killed time from about 11a until my flight out of JFK at 6p. So I walked around Wall Street for a bit (a very short street, incidentally), walked by the Bank of New York, by the Stock Exchange. The Bank of New York is interesting &ndash; formerly known as the Bank of America, founded in our Constitution in 1787 by Alexander Hamliton. There&rsquo;s some interesting history there. (Great telling of the story is in Joeseph Ellis&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Founding Brothers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.) Then I walked over to Battery Park, just at the Southern tip of Manhattan, and looked across at the Statue of Liberty &ndash; the first time that I had really seen it. Tried to imagine France giving us a present in the current day. Sigh. But nevertheless inspirational to be there and look out on Ellis Island and think of all the amazing people that have been there. How many people set out to start new lives here and founded whole branches of their families. I know it&rsquo;s a trite image, but it sure is inspirational, still. There are some truly great things about the American story &ndash; a lot of them are getting lost lately, which is too bad.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was glad to see that part of New York and think about it for a while.</p>

			 <p>Some of you know that I&rsquo;ve been struggling a bit lately with back pain &ndash; every once in a while my lower back just starts killing me, making it hard to bend, and sometimes hard to walk. Started a few months ago in August &ndash; suspiciously the day after the girlies' birthday party when I picked up Andrew (he&rsquo;s now ginormous) when he bonked his head.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s been happening on and off lately, generally exacerbated by my flying schedule. This Thanksgiving trip (chronicled in another post) caused a whole new level though. Ended up spending most of Thanksgiving weekend on my back at Mom&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Went to see the doc at Palo Alto Medical Foundation yesterday, who basically checked me out to make sure it&rsquo;s not the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; kind of back pain, and merely the &ldquo;good&rdquo; sort. Mine is the good sort, and he basically told me to pay more attention when I excercise, and I think it goes without saying that I should stop taking 27 hour trips.</p>
<p>Anyhoo. Nothing really to worry about, but somthing to work on. Man, last year I hardly even knew I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->had<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a back &ndash; now it&rsquo;s a major part of my life. Sigh.</p>

			 <p>Just thought that I&rsquo;d write down here that it&rsquo;s been a very very good week. No one thing in particular, just a lot of things with work, family &amp; friends just went very very well this week.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>He himself did his best to acknowledge it when
times were sweet. We could be drinking lemonade in
the shade of an apple tree in the summertime, and
Uncle Alex would interrupt the conversation to say, &ldquo;If
this isn&rsquo;t nice, what is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I myself say that out loud at times of easy, natural
bliss: &ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t nice, what is?&rdquo; Perhaps others can
also make use of that heirloom from Uncle Alex. I find
it really cheers me up to keep score out loud that way.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t written here about leaving Reactivity before &ndash; but think it&rsquo;s getting to be public enough that it&rsquo;s safe to write a few things now. I think it&rsquo;s going to take me a bunch of time to really understand my time there, and suspect that writing will help me some.</p>
<p>Anyway, Thursday was my last board meeting. Brian Roddy now represents Common Stock on our board now, and I think that&rsquo;s a great transition (he&rsquo;s been saying lately that he feels like one of the last people left on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Survivor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.) We started having monthly board meetings when we closed our Series A in April 2000, and have had a few more frequently than that, so I figure that makes maybe 60 board meetings that I&rsquo;ve participated in. It&rsquo;s funny to think back to our first board meeting when we just didn&rsquo;t know anything. Lots of mistakes. (first question: &ldquo;where is the $23M that you raised?&rdquo;. me: &ldquo;um, in checking&rdquo;. rest of board:  &ldquo;maybe you could fix that between now &amp; the next meeting?&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>In fact, thinking back to when we started Reactivity, it just seems like so long ago. 7 years ago now &ndash; I was 26 years old. I feel like I&rsquo;ve grown up with and through Reactivity. When we started, I had never been to a board meeting. Never talked with a VC. Never raised money. Never sold anything to anyone. Thinking about the difference in perspective now is just amazing to me. I&rsquo;ll miss it a ton. Even with all the ups &amp; downs, challenges &amp; mistakes, victories &amp; losses. Like I say, I feel like I&rsquo;ve grown up during my time here. Excited to do whatever I&rsquo;ll do next, but also cognizant of the fact that I&rsquo;ll never again start my first startup. Time moves on, I suppose.</p>
<p>One other board story: for our first board meeting, we didn&rsquo;t much know what to do, so Brian, Bryan and I must have spent a week preparing for it. Maybe 30 or 40 Powerpoint slides highlighting the status of the business, what we were working on, etc. And so we started the meeting, with these people in the room that we were still pretty overwhelmed by. Mitch Kapor was our first investor, chairman of the company, and just a titan to us. Tom Byers was on the board, a well-known Stanford professor and accomplished entrepreneur in his own right. Peter Fenton was there, too, whose family has been influential in Silicon Valley for decades &ndash; and who is himself becoming a great VC. On maybe the first 3 slides, we were just going through the update, and Mitch says: &ldquo;STOP READING THE SLIDES.&rdquo; In a sophisticated way, we responded, &ldquo;hunh?&rdquo;. And Mitch said: &ldquo;We can all read what you&rsquo;ve written. Just talk to us.&rdquo; Seems funny now that we were so intimidated by that back then, but we were. But I&rsquo;ll tell you, those few words had just a huge impact on me. I never, ever read slides that I&rsquo;m showing anymore &ndash; and, more significantly, I mostly now try to just have conversations with people instead of presenting. That was Mitch&rsquo;s real message: nobody really likes being presented to, or spun to &ndash; they were there to help, and wanted us to treat them like that. Small point of view change that has had huge implications for me over the years since.</p>
<p>Anyway, Thursday was my last Reactivity board meeting. I&rsquo;ll miss them. I learned a lot and grew up a lot and had a good time in that position.</p>
<p>More on Reactivity over the next few weeks &amp; months.</p>
<p>(Oh, one other thing. I talk about Reactivity here like it was an individual thing. Starting it with Brian and Bryan, and then with Mike &ndash; that&rsquo;s what made it all worth it. One thing that I don&rsquo;t say enough, though, is that Kathy has been here and supportive and involved every minute, even when it was a little painful. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done to deserve that kind of support, but I&rsquo;m awfully grateful that Kathy has shared this experience with me.)</p>

			 <p>Spent 11 hours in Philadelphia yesterday. Not exactly enough time to get a real feel for a place. It&rsquo;s the second time I&rsquo;ve been there &ndash; both times for Reactivity.</p>
<p>This time was a real whirlwind &ndash; because of a weather issue, we ended up taking the red-eye from San Francisco, getting to PHL at 7a, getting into our downtown hotel around 8a, then taking a shower and heading out for lunch a little bit later.</p>
<p>A few impressions: driving into Philly, it really feels a lot like what I think of as the prototypical East Coast industrial port city &ndash; made even more prototypical by the 40 degree rain. Brrr. But you know what I&rsquo;m talking about: lots of green steel bridges, lots of gray skies, lots of processing factories steaming into the sky.</p>
<p>But driving through the city, all I could think of was Ben Franklin. All the red bricks, the Revolution Era buildings &ndash; impossible not to feel that history. It turns out that we had lunch at the King of Prussia Mall, on our way out to see a customer in Valley Forge, PA &ndash; with some history in of its own.</p>
<p>One of the parts of travel that I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed is getting to see all these places (like Valley Forge) that have always just been names in books. Living over here in California, I sometimes forget that places have history. The history that I feel most acutely here is Silicon Valley history &ndash; which is really not very old. 50ish years. Sometimes I think in terms of California history &ndash; but, again, not so old.</p>
<p>Anyway, I like going to places with a bit of a sense of time. I&rsquo;ve been out of the states a few times now &ndash; including to Thailand for a bit, and Ireland &amp; the UK for a few weeks &ndash; and those places have a &ldquo;history around us&rdquo; feeling, too. But something about places in American history still moves me.</p>
<p>Anyway, Philadelphia isn&rsquo;t a place that I&rsquo;d really like to live, I don&rsquo;t think, but 11 hours at a time isn&rsquo;t really enough, either.</p>
<p>Watch for lots of posts coming up this week as my travels take me to Toronto, Rochester NY, Montreal (for the first time), and Manhattan &ndash; and, if I&rsquo;m lucky, to a bonus destination on Friday: Memphis.</p>

			 <p>My great aunt Laura Lilly McMichael died yesterday afternoon, at the age of 95. She&rsquo;d moved to Atlanta a couple of years ago, away from Quitman, GA, where she lived virtually her whole life.</p>
<p>Laura was the 4th of 5 children of my great grandfather, Homer Lilly &ndash; she came a couple of years after my Grandee was born; she was his little sister. Their sister (Ellie, 2nd of 5), my grandfather and Laura lived almost their whole lives in Quitman, just a couple of blocks away from each other. Think of that.</p>
<p>Laura was married to Bill McMichael, a man that I remember from my childhood as being approximately 10 feet tall. In pictures he sure looks like maybe he wasn&rsquo;t quite that tall, but my memory seems clear. He was a big, friendly man to me always &ndash; seems like he was always holding court in the study of their big house, smoking a cigar and making jokes.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be remembering about Laura without at least mentioning her house. She &amp; Bill lived in a beautiful white house on the main street of Quitman &ndash; with a white picket fence, and trees with spanish moss, and everything you&rsquo;d see in a movie about the South. She really loved that house. My 2nd cousin, Mary Michael Stewart, her granddaughter, told me once that Laura didn&rsquo;t have pictures of her grandkids in her wallet, but did have a number of pictures of the house.</p>
<p>In very many ways, Laura is who I think of when I think of the South &ndash; her house, her mannerisms, her speech, the way she was involved in church and the community. A lot of Jessica Tandy&rsquo;s character in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Driving Miss Daisy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reminds me of her. (And my grandmother, too, but in a different way.)</p>
<p>We got to see Laura in Atlanta just a few weeks ago, and I&rsquo;m thankful to have gotten to do that. She seemed happy &amp; engaged, and pretty much in charge of the conversation, like every time I can really remember talking to her. She reminded me of my grandfather a few times during the conversation, and I&rsquo;m thankful for that, too.</p>
<p>Hurricane Ivan notwithstanding, Laura will be buried in Quitman later this week, next to Bill, I think, and nearby just about everyone that I knew in Quitman, where my dad grew up. Think of that, too.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;d recommend you read anything that Richard Russo writes &ndash; he&rsquo;s fantastic. I read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Empire Falls<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a couple of years back &ndash; a Pulitzer-winning novel. His novels aren&rsquo;t really about all that much &ndash; mostly about small town life in the Northeast. But here&rsquo;s why I read them: he writes with such empathy that you can&rsquo;t help but like his main protagonist (in both books, a middle-aged man who&rsquo;s too much a smartass for his own good, but can&rsquo;t really help himself). Here&rsquo;s the quote of the main character, who&rsquo;s teaching his creative writing class:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is good fiction more likely to be about the air we breathe or the nose we breathe it through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asks it as a leading question to his class; he&rsquo;s saying that good fiction isn&rsquo;t about the stuff that&rsquo;s obvious &amp; all around us &ndash; at some level, that&rsquo;s history, or journalism, or something else. Good fiction helps us to understand our relationship with all that. I hadn&rsquo;t thought about it in quite those terms before, but think it&rsquo;s great &amp; right on.</p>
<p>The book is funny, and painful, and true &ndash; I think the excerpt below (main character, 1st person point of view) is central (don&rsquo;t read it if you want to read the book soon &ndash; it might not even make any sense):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the truth is, we never know for sure about ourselves. Who we&rsquo;ll sleep with given the opportunity, who we&rsquo;ll betray in the right circumstance, whose faith and love we will reward with our own&hellip;Only after we&rsquo;ve done a thing do we know what we&rsquo;ll do, and by then whatever we&rsquo;ve done has already begun to sever itself from clear significance, at least for the doer. Which is why we have spouses and children and parents and colleagues and friends, because someone has to know us better than we know ourselves. We need them to tell us. We need them to say, &ldquo;I know you, Al. You&rsquo;re not the kind of man who.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great book.</p>

			 <p>Took my third trip to Detroit last week (and drove up to London, Ontario for a quick meeting as well) &ndash; went to see GM &amp; DaimlerChrysler. First, I should say that GM &amp; Chrysler are both incredibly impressive, and I thought it was sort of cool that I got to visit two of the largest companies in the world in the same day.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&rsquo;ve got to say that I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of Detroit. The downtown is pretty clearly depressed &ndash; it reminds me a lot of Rochester, NY, even though it&rsquo;s much bigger. When you&rsquo;re in Rochester, it&rsquo;s impossible not to think about the city and how it must have been incredibly vibrant, right until the Erie Canal got built and they didn&rsquo;t need it any more. With Detroit, you&rsquo;re forced to the (obvious) conclusion that the global markets have passed American autos by &ndash; and you&rsquo;ve got to wonder what the hell they would have done if they hadn&rsquo;t invented the SUV in the nineties.</p>
<p>But Canada was nice, as always. Very polite, very clean, very friendly. London is a university town &ndash; but to be honest, I didn&rsquo;t get to see much of it &ndash; most of the 6 hours I spent in Canada this time was driving (2 hrs each way) and on the phone (lots of conference calls).</p>

			 <p>This goes into the obvious file, but I&rsquo;ve just got to say that the
emergence of digital music is absolutely incredible. I&rsquo;m currently on a 6
hour flight from SJC -&gt; JFK, and I&rsquo;ve been working on my laptop and
listening to music the whole way. [Quick aside: I&rsquo;ve been flying a bunch of
different airlines this year, but have to say that American is hands down
my happiest situation &ndash; more leg room, power outlets in the seats, and
gold status will get me exit row seats, which helps a LOT.]</p>
<p>Anyway, so I&rsquo;ve just put my whole music collection on shuffle and have been
listening to a bunch of different things. The idea that I could have every
song that I own with me all the time is just wacky. And it turns out that
between my laptop and my iPod, I&rsquo;ve actually got <strong>two</strong> copies of every
song that I own (and a few that I don&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>On every single trip I&rsquo;ve been on with my iPod, I end up listening to songs
I haven&rsquo;t heard in years &ndash; and always listen to one or two a few times,
because they really speak to me. For example, a couple of trips ago, I
ended up listening to British Band music by Holst &amp; Vaughn Williams. The
last time that I really listened to that stuff was in high school, when our
band played a bunch of it &ndash; but it all came back to me. Actually, &ldquo;came
back to me&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t quite the right way to phrase it &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s all just
inside me somewhere. The melodies and rhythms and beats all just felt
super-natural to me &ndash; and it was pretty emotional to listen to, because it
all brought back memories of a different time for me &ndash; I guess it was
about 20 years ago now, in high school. The music hit me at a gut
emotional, no memories level, but it also was fun to think about what life
was like back then. How the complexities and responsibilities and joys were
so different. It&rsquo;s a little bit like the occasions when I drive around
Austin late on summer nights &ndash; the hot, sticky air always reminds me of
driving after football games in high school. Nice memories.</p>
<p>And a lot of times I&rsquo;ll end up really listening to a song for the first
time &ndash; the other day I listened to Jeff Buckley&rsquo;s Hallelujah about 10
times in a row. (You may remember it from The West Wing, from the season
finale of Season 3, when Mark Harmon&rsquo;s character gets killed.) I had always
really liked the music, but for some reason on that day at that time, I
just really paid attention to what he was doing with his voice, and the
lyrics, and his guitar. I&rsquo;m listening to a ton more music than I have in a
really long time.</p>
<p>Like I said. Sublime.</p>

			 <p>Well, sort of like The Bourne Identity, just as long, but a lot more
boring, and a lot more tortured in terms of storyline. I got about halfway
through the book and just decided that I didn&rsquo;t care much about the
characters or the story, so I quit. Maybe I&rsquo;ll pick it up again at some
point, but I doubt it. The character is still interesting, but he basically
figured out who he is in the first book, so this one has to go to some
wacky lengths to keep up the premise. Not perfect. I think I&rsquo;ll skip
picking up the third book in the series.</p>
